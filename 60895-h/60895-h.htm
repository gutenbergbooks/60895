<i>PUBLISHERS' NOTE</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>Of all the love stories in history possibly none had more
intense reactions upon politics than that of Charles Stewart
Parnell and Katharine O'Shea, which is unfolded with
candour so compelling in this record of their life.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The engrossing interest in Ireland has demanded a new
and popular edition of Mrs. Parnell's book.  No real
comprehension of the Irish question is possible without a
thorough knowledge of Parnell's life and his part in the
creation of the modern Home Rule movement; and no
intimate knowledge of Parnell's character and the springs
of his policy during the critical decade of the 'eighties can
be had without studying the revelations of his
correspondence with his wife.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>In this edition some abridgment has been necessary to
bring the book within the compass of a single volume.  The
less material parts of Mrs. Parnell's narrative of her own
girlhood have been curtailed, and the long correspondence
of Captain O'Shea has been summarised in a note appended
to Chapter xxvii.  One or two omissions are indicated
in footnotes.  The text has been subject to no other

MRS. PARNELL'S PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
</p>

<p class="noindent">
On October 6th, 1891, nearly twenty-three years ago,
Charles Stewart Parnell died in the arms of his wife;
nearly twenty-three years ago the whole of the civilized
world awoke to laud&mdash;or to condemn&mdash;the dead chief.  It
ranked him with the greatest heroes, or with the vilest
sinners, of the world, because he had found and kept the
haven of her arms with absolute disregard of that world's
praise or blame, till death, the only power greater than the
love that held him there, tore him from them.
</p>

<p>
And then the hate that followed him to the grave turned
to the woman he had loved, to vent upon her its baffled
spleen; not considering that such a man as he would keep
the heart of his wife as closely in death as he had kept it
in life, so closely that none could come near it, so secretly
that none could find the way to plant therein a sting.  And
so for these more than twenty-two years, I, his wife, have
lived upon memories so happy and so precious that, after
time had brought back some meaning to my life, I took a
certain pleasure in reading all men had to say of him
whom they so little knew.  Never in all the "lives,"
"articles," or "appreciations" I read had there been one
that could say&mdash;or one that desired to say&mdash;that Parnell
was not a man who stands out sharp and clear from other
men for good or ill.
</p>

<p>
But now, after all these years, one of Parnell's erstwhile
followers has arisen to explain to another generation
that Parnell was not really such a man as this, that he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Px"></a>x}</span>
was one of Ireland's eternal failures.  One who held her
dear indeed, but one who balanced her welfare against the
clutches of a light o' love with all the foolishness of callow
degeneracy, so fondly imagined chivalry by the weak.
Not a man who gave his country his whole life, and found
the peace and courage of that life in the heart of the
woman he loved.  No, that is how a man lives and loves,
whether in secret or before the whole world.  That is how
Parnell lived and loved, and now after these long years
I break my silence lest the unmanly echo of excuse given
forth by Mr. O'Brien in an age that loves excuse may
cling about the name of the man I loved.  It is a very
poignant pain to me to give to the world any account of
the sacred happiness of eleven years of my life and of the
agony of sorrow that once seemed too great to bear; but
I have borne it, and I am so near him now that I fear to
leave near the name of that proud spirit the taint of excuse
that he loathed.
</p>

<p>
Parnell never posed as "rather the victim than the
destroyer of a happy home," as Mr. O'Brien suggested in
the <i>Cork Free Press</i> of last year, and he maintained to
the last day of his life that he suffered no "dishonour and
discredit" in making the woman he loved his own.
</p>

<p>
And because Parnell contravened certain social laws,
not regarding them as binding him in any way, and
because I joined him in this contravention since his love
made all else of no account to me, we did not shrink at
the clamour of the upholders of those outraged laws, nor
resent the pressing of the consequences that were
inevitable and always foreseen.  The freedom of choice we had
ourselves claimed we acknowledged for others, and were
wise enough to smile if, in some instances, the greatness
of our offence was loudly proclaimed by those who he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxi"></a>xi}</span>
knew lived in a freedom of love more varied than our
own.  For the hypocrisy of those statesmen and politicians
who, knowing for ten years that Parnell was my lover,
had with the readiest tact and utmost courtesy accepted
the fact as making a sure and safe channel of communication
with him, whom they knew as a force to be placated;
for those who, when the time came to stand by him in order
to give Ireland the benefits they had promised him for
her, repudiated him from under the cloak of the religion
they thereby forswore, he, and I with him, felt a
contempt unspeakable.
</p>

<p>
In this book I am giving to the public letters so sacred
to my lover and myself that no eyes other than our own
should ever have seen them, but that my son was jealous
for his father's honour, and that I would not my lover's
life should seem in these softer days a lesser thing, beset
with fears and indecisions that he did not know.  I have,
lived in those eleven years of Parnell's love so constantly
that nothing has been lost to me of them, and the few
details of them that I give will show a little of what manner
of man he was, while still I keep for my own heart so
much that none shall ever know but he and I.
</p>

<p>
In regard to the political aspect of the book those who
know the Irish history of those days will understand.  My
lover was the leader of a nation in revolt, and, as I could,
I helped him as "King's Messenger" to the Government
in office.  It has been erroneously said by some of the
Irish Party that I "inspired" certain measures of his, and
biased him in various ways politically.  Those who have
said so did not know the man, for Parnell was before all
a statesman; absolutely convinced of his policy and of
his ability to carry that policy to its logical conclusion.
Self-reliant and far-seeing, the master of his own mind.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxii"></a>xii}</span>
</p>

<p>
I was never a "political lady," and, apart from him,
I have never felt the slightest interest in politics, either
Irish or English, and I can honestly say that except for
urging him to make terms with the Government in order
to obtain his liberation from prison, I did not once
throughout those eleven years attempt to use my influence over
him to "bias" his public life or politics; nor, being
convinced that his opinions and measures were the only ones
worth consideration, was I even tempted to do so.  In
my many interviews with Mr. Gladstone I was Parnell's
messenger, and in all other work I did for him it was
understood on both sides that I worked for Parnell alone.

THOMPSON.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
My father, Sir John Page Wood, was descended from the
Woods of Tiverton, and was the eldest of the three sons
of Sir Matthew Wood, Baronet, of Hatherley House,
Gloucestershire.  He was educated at Winchester and at
Trinity College, Cambridge, and after entering into holy
orders, before he was twenty-four years of age, was
appointed private chaplain and secretary to Queen
Caroline, performing the last offices for her at her death
in 1820, and attending her body to its final resting-place
in Brunswick.  He then became chaplain to the Duke of
Sussex, and in 1824 was appointed by the Corporation of
London to the rectory of St. Peter's, Cornhill.
</p>

<p>
In 1820 my father married Emma Caroline, the youngest
of the three daughters of Admiral Michell (and my
father's uncle, Benjamin Wood, M.P. for Southwark at
the time, married the second daughter, Maria, the "Aunt
Ben" of this book).  She was eighteen.  My father was
still at Cambridge.  The improvident young pair found
it difficult to live on the small allowance that was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
considered sufficient for my father at college.  They appear
to have been very happy notwithstanding their difficulties,
which were augmented a year later by the birth of
a son; and while my father became "coach" to young
men of slower wit, my mother, who was extremely talented
with her brush, cheerfully turned her beautiful miniature
painting to account for the benefit of her young husband
and son.  She soon became an exhibitor of larger works
in London, and the brothers Finden engraved several of
her pictures.
</p>

<p>
She and my father seem to have idolized their first
child, "Little John," and his early death, at about four
years old, was their first real sorrow.  The boy was too
precocious, and when he was three years old his proud
young parents were writing "he can read well now, and
is getting on splendidly with his Latin!"
</p>

<p>
Constable, the artist, was a friend of my mother's, who
thought highly of her work, and gave her much encouragement,
and the young people seem to have had no lack of
friends in the world of art and letters.  Of my mother,
Charles Sheridan said he "delighted in her sparkling
sallies," and the young Edwin Landseer was "mothered"
by her to his "exceeding comfort."
</p>

<p>
My mother was appointed bedchamber woman to
Queen Caroline, and became very fond of her.  The
consort of George IV. appears to have taken the greatest
interest in "Little John," and I had until a short time
ago&mdash;when it was stolen&mdash;a little workbox containing a
half-finished sock the Queen was knitting for the little boy when
her fatal illness began.
</p>

<p>
My parents then lived in London for some years while
my father did duty at St. Peter's.  In 1832 my father
became vicar of Cressing, in Essex, and he took my
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
mother and their (I think three) children there, leaving a
curate in charge of St. Peter's.  Thirteen children in all
were born to my parents (of whom I was the thirteenth),
and of my brothers and sisters there were seven living
at the time of my birth.
</p>

<p>
There was little room for all these young people in
the vicarage at Cressing, and it was so extremely damp
as to be unhealthy; so my parents moved to Glazenwood,
a charming house with the most beautiful gardens I have
ever seen in a place of moderate size.  I think my brother
Fred died here; but my first memories are of Rivenhall,
where my parents moved soon after my birth.  Rivenhall
Place belonged to a friend of my father's, Sir Thomas
Sutton Weston, of Felix Hall.  The beautiful old place
was a paradise for growing children, and the space and
beauty of this home of my youth left me with a sad
distaste for the little houses of many conveniences that it
has been my lot to inhabit for the greater part of my
life.
</p>

<p>
In politics my father was a thoroughgoing Whig, and
as he was an able and fluent speaker, and absolutely
fearless in his utterances, he became a great influence in the
county during election times.  I remember, when he was
to speak at a political meeting, how he laughed as he tied
me up in enormous orange ribbons and made me drive
him there, and how immensely proud of him I was
(though, of course, I could not understand a word of it
all) as he spoke so persuasively that howls and ribald cries
turned to cheers for "Sir John's man."
</p>

<p>
When he went to London to "take duty" at St. Peter's
Cornhill, he and I used to stay at the Green Dragon,
Bishopsgate Street.  There was a beautiful old courtyard
to this hotel with a balcony, overhung with creepers,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
running all round the upper rooms.  I loved this place,
and when I was too young to care much for the long
service and sermons, I was quite content that my father
should tuck me up safely in bed before going to evensong
at St. Peter's.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I was not well enough to go to London
with him, and on these occasions comforted myself as
much as possible with a compensating interest in the
habits of the Rev. Thomas Grosse, who took my father's
place at Cressing.  He was very good and kind to me, and
in the summer evenings, when he knew I was missing
my father, he would take me out to look for glow-worms,
and show me the stars, teaching me the names of the
planets.  Years afterwards the knowledge I thus gained
became a great happiness to me, as I taught Mr. Parnell
all I knew of astronomy, and opened up to him a new
world of absorbing interest.
</p>

<p>
Friends of my brother Evelyn frequently stayed at
Rivenhall, and one of them, a colonel of Light Dragoons,
was engaged to one of my elder sisters.  This gentleman
appealed to my youthful mind as being all that a hero
should be, and I used to stick a red fez on my golden
curls and gallop my pony past the dining-room windows
so that he might see and admire the intrepid maiden, as
the prince in my fairy book did!
</p>

<p>
I loved the winter evenings at Rivenhall when my
brothers were not at home.  My father used to sit by
the fire reading his <i>Times</i>, with his great white cat on
his knee, while I made his tea and hot buttered toast, and
my mother and sister Anna read or sketched.  I used to
write the plots of tragic little stories which my "Pip"[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>]
used to read and call "blood-stained bandits," owing to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
violent action and the disregard of convention shown by
all the characters concerned.
</p>

<p>
However, these childish efforts of mine led to greater
results, as one evening my mother and sister laughingly
offered to buy my "plot" in order to "write it up" into
a novel.  I was, of course, very proud to sell my idea, and
thenceforth both my mother and sister wrote many successful
novels, published by Chapman and Hall&mdash;and, I
believe, at prices that are rarely realized by present-day
novelists.
</p>

<p>
I was thus the unwitting means of greatly relieving
my parents' anxiety of how to meet, with their not very
large income, the heavy expense of educating and
maintaining my brothers, and the responsibilities of their
position.
</p>

<p>
My brothers loved to tease me, and, as I was so much
younger than they, I never understood if they were really
serious or only laughing at me.  Evelyn was specially
adroit in bewildering me, and used to curb my rebellion,
when I was reluctant to fetch and carry for him, by drawing
a harrowing picture of my remorse should he be killed
"in the next war."  The horror of this thought kept me
a ready slave for years, till one day, in a gust of temper,
I burst out with: "I shan't be sorry at all when you're
killed in a war cos' I didn't find your silly things, and
I wish you'd go away and be a dead hero now, so there!"  I
remember the horrified pause of my mother and sister
and then the howl of laughter and applause from Evelyn
and Charlie.  Evelyn was very good to me after this,
and considered, more, that even little girls have their
feelings.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, my mother was so entirely wrapped
up in Evelyn that I think I was jealous, even though I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
had my father so much to myself.  My mother was most
affectionate to all her children, but Evelyn was her idol,
and from the time when, as a mere lad, he was wounded
in the Crimean War, to the day of her death, he was first
in all her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Of my brothers and sisters I really knew only four at
all well.  Clarissa had died at seventeen, and Fred when
I was very young; Frank was away with his regiment,
my sister Pollie was married and away in India before I
was born, and my sister Emma married Sir Thomas
Barrett-Lennard while I was still very young.  She was
always very kind to me, and I used to love going to visit
her at her house in Brighton.  Visiting Sir Thomas
Barrett-Lennard's country seat, Belhus, I did not like so
much, because, though Belhus is very beautiful, I loved
Rivenhall better.
</p>

<p>
My mother was a fine musician, and as I grew older,
I began to long to play as she did.  There was a beautiful
grand piano in the drawing-room, and I used to try
to pick out tunes upon it.  My mother had spent much
money on her eldest daughter's&mdash;Maria's (Pollie)&mdash;musical
education.  At the end of this Pollie said she detested it,
and would never play a note again if she could help it.
When I asked that I might be taught to play my mother
said, "No.  There is the piano; go and play it if you
really want to learn."  In time I could play very well
by ear, and began to compose a little and seek for wider
knowledge.  My love of music led me to try composition,
and I used to set to music any verses that took my
fancy.  Among these I was much pleased with
Longfellow's "Weariness," and was so encouraged by my
mother's praise of the setting that I sent the poet a copy.
I was a very happy girl when he wrote to thank me,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
saying that mine was the best setting of his poem he had
ever heard.
</p>

<p>
Armed with the manuscript of this music and some
others, the next time I went to London with my father
I went to Boosey's, the musical publishers, and asked
their representative to publish them.
</p>

<p>
"Quite impossible, my dear young lady," he answered
at once.  "We never take beginners' work!"  I plaintively
remarked that even Mozart was a "beginner" once,
and could not understand why he laughed.  Still, with a
smile, he consented to look at the manuscript, and to
my joy he ceased to laugh at me and tried some of it
over, finally agreeing, much to my joy, to publish
"Weariness" and a couple of other songs.
</p>

<p>
I remember my father's pleasure and the merry
twinkle in his eye as he gravely assented to my
suggestion that we were a very gifted family!
</p>

<p>
While my brother Frank (who was in the 17th Foot)
was stationed at Aldershot he invited my sister Anna
and myself down to see a review.  He was married, and
we stayed with him and his wife and children in the
married officers' quarters, which appeared to us to be very
gay and amusing.
</p>

<p>
I greatly enjoyed seeing the cavalry, with all the
officers and men in full dress.
</p>

<p>
Many of the officers came over to call after the review,
and among them was Willie O'Shea, who was then a
cornet in the 18th Hussars.  There was a small drama
acted by the officers in the evening which my brother's
wife took us to see, and there were many of the 18th
Hussars, who paid us much attention, though, personally,
I found the elderly and hawk-eyed colonel of the regiment
far more interesting than the younger men.

CHAPTER II
<br />
VISITORS AT RIVENHALL
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>A chiel's amang you takin' notes,<br />
  And, faith, he'll prent it!</i>"&mdash;BURNS.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Among other visitors to Rivenhall was Lieut.-Colonel
Steele, of the Lancers, a dark, handsome man, who married
my sister Anna.
</p>

<p>
I remember looking at Anna consideringly when I was
told this was to be, for, as children do, I had hitherto
merely regarded Anna as a sister too "grown-up" to
play with on equal terms, and yet not as a person sufficiently
interesting to be married to one of the magnificent
beings who, like Evelyn's friends, wore such beautiful
uniforms and jingly spurs.  But my sister had soft brown
hair and a lovely skin, blue eyes that were mocking, gay,
or tender in response to many moods, and a very pretty
figure.  And I solemnly decided that she was really pretty,
and quite "grown-up" enough to be loved by the
"beautiful ones."
</p>

<p>
Anthony Trollope was a great friend of my father
and mother, and used to stay with us a good deal for
hunting.  He was a very hard rider to hounds, and was
a cause of great anxiety to my mother, for my sister Anna
loved an intrepid "lead" out hunting, and delighted in
following Trollope, who stuck at nothing.  I used to
rejoice in his "The Small House at Allington," and go
about fitting the characters in the book to the people about
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
me&mdash;a mode of amusement that palled considerably on the
victims.
</p>

<p>
I was always glad when our young cousin George
(afterwards Sir George) Farwell (Lord Justice Farwell)
came to see us.  A dear lad, who quite won my childish
admiration with his courtly manners and kind,
considerate ways.
</p>

<p>
The Hon. Grantley-Barkley (who was seventy, I
believe) was a dear old man who was very fond of me&mdash;as
I was of him.  I was but a child when he informed my
parents that he wished to marry me when I was old
enough!  He was a dear friend of my father's, but,
though the latter would not consider the matter seriously,
my mother, who was an extraordinarily sympathetic
woman, encouraged the idea.
</p>

<p>
Grantley-Barkley was always called the "Deer-slayer"
by his friends.  A fine old sportsman, his house, "The
Hut," at Poole, Dorset, was a veritable museum of slain
beasts, and I used to shudder secretly at the idea of
becoming mistress of so many heads and horns.
</p>

<p>
The dear old man used to write long letters to me
before I could answer them in anything but laborious
print, and he wrote sheets to my mother inquiring of my
welfare and the direction of my education.  I still have
many of the verses he composed in my honour, and though
the last line of the verse that I insert worries me now as
much as it did when I received it, so many years ago,
I still think it very pretty sentiment:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Then the Bird that above me is singing<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall chase the thought that is drear,<br />
  When the soul to <i>her</i> side it is winging<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limbs <i>must</i> be lingering near!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This little one-sided romance died a natural death as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
I grew up, my old friend continuing to take the kindest
interest in me, but accepting the fact that I was no
exception to the law of youth that calls to youth in mating.
</p>

<p>
My brother Frank suggested to my brother-in-law, Sir
Thomas Barrett-Lennard, that Willie O'Shea, who was
a first-class steeplechase rider, would no doubt, if asked,
ride the horse Honesty that Tom was going to run in the
Brentwood Steeplechase.  He had already ridden and won
many races.  Willie readily agreed to ride, and came to
stay at Belhus for the race.
</p>

<p>
I was staying there at the time, and though I was
considered too young to be really "out," as a rule I had
my share in any festivities that were going on.  I
remember my brother-in-law saying casually to my sister Emma,
who was giving a dinner party that evening: "Who is
Katie to go in with, milady?" and she answered promptly,
"Oh, she shall go in with O'Shea."  A mild witticism
that rather ruffled my youthful sense of importance.
</p>

<p>
My first sight of Willie then, as a grown-up, was on
this evening, when I came rather late into the hall before
dressing for dinner.  He was standing near the fire,
talking, with the eagerness that was not in those days bad
form in young men, of the steeplechase he had ridden and
won on Early Bird.
</p>

<p>
I had been so much the companion of older men than
he that I was pleased with his youthful looks and vivacity.
His dress pleased me also, and, though it would appear
a terrible affair in the eyes of a modern young man, it was
perfectly correct then for a young officer in the 18th
Hussars, and extremely becoming to Willie: a brown
velvet coat, cut rather fully, sealskin waistcoat,
black-and-white check trousers, and an enormous carbuncle and
diamond pin in his curiously folded scarf.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
</p>

<p>
When introduced to me he was most condescending,
and nettled me so much by his kindly patronage of my
youthfulness that I promptly plunged into such a
discussion of literary complexities, absorbed from my elders
and utterly undigested, and he soon subsided into a
bewildered and shocked silence.
</p>

<p>
However, in the few days of that visit we became very
good friends, and I was immensely pleased when, on
parting, Willie presented me with a really charming little
poem written about my "golden hair and witsome speech."
</p>

<p>
Of course, as usual, I flew to show my father, who,
reading, sighed, "Ah, too young for such nonsense.  I
want my Pippin for myself for years to come."[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
In the summer at Belhus I met Willie again.  Unconsciously
we seemed to drift together in the long summer
days.  The rest of the household intent on their own
affairs, we were content to be left together to explore the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
cool depths of the glades, where the fallow deer ran before
us, or the kitchen garden, where the high walls were
covered with rose-coloured peaches, warm with the sun as
we ate them.  What we talked about I cannot remember,
but it was nothing very wise I should imagine.
</p>

<p>
Week after week went by in our trance of contentment.
I did not look forward, but was content to exist
in the languorous summer heat&mdash;dreaming through the
sunny days with Willie by my side, and thinking not
at all of the future.  I suppose my elders were content
with the situation, as they must have known that such
propinquity could have but one ending.
</p>

<p>
There was a man by whom I was attracted and who
had paid me considerable attention&mdash;E.S., stationed at
Purfleet.  He was a fine athlete, and used to fill me with
admiration by jumping over my pony's back without
touching him at all.  I sometimes thought idly of him
during these days with Willie, but was content to drift
along, until one day my sister asked me to drive over with
a note of invitation to dinner for the officers at Purfleet.
</p>

<p>
In the cool of the evening I set out, with Willie, of
course, in attendance.  Willie, on arrival, sprang out of
the pony cart to deliver the note, and as he was jumping
in again glanced up at the window above us, where it
happened E. S. and another officer were standing.
Without a moment's hesitation Willie leant forward and kissed
me full on the lips.  Furious and crimson with the
knowledge that the men at the window had seen him kiss me,
I hustled my poor little pony home, vowing I would never
speak to Willie again; but his apologies and explanation
that he had only just wanted "to show those fellows that
they must not make asses of themselves" seemed so funny
and in keeping with the dreamy sense I had of belonging
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
to Willie that I soon forgave him, though I felt a little
stab of regret when I found that E. S. declined the
invitation to dinner.  He never came again.
</p>

<p>
Willie had now to rejoin his regiment, and in the
evening before his going, as I was leaving the drawing-room,
he stopped to offer me a rose, kissing me on the
face and hair as he did so.
</p>

<p>
A few mornings after I was sleeping the dreamless
sleep of healthy girlhood when I was awakened by feeling
a thick letter laid on my cheek and my mother leaning over
me singing "Kathleen Mavourneen" in her rich contralto
voice.  I am afraid I was decidedly cross at having been
awakened so suddenly, and, clasping my letter unopened,
again subsided into slumber.
</p>

<p>
So far nearly all my personal communication with
Willie when he was away had been carried on by telegraph,
and I had not quite arrived at knowing what to
reply to the sheets of poetic prose which flowed from his
pen.  Very frequently he came down just for a day to
Rivenhall, and I drove to meet him at the station with
my pony-chaise.  Then we used to pass long hours at the
lake fishing for pike, or talking to my father, who was
always cheered by his society.
</p>

<p>
At this time Colonel Clive, of the Grenadier Guards,
was a frequent visitor.  I was really fond of him, and he
pleased me by his pleasure in hearing me sing to my own
accompaniment.  I spent some happy hours in doing so
for him when staying at Claridge's Hotel with my sister,
and I remember that when I knew he was coming I used
to twist a blue ribbon in my hair to please him.
</p>

<p>
Once, when staying at Claridge's, my sister and I
went to his rooms to see the sketches of a friend of my
brother Evelyn's, Mr. Hozier, the clever newspaper
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
correspondent, afterwards Sir H. Hozier, and father of
Mrs. Winston Churchill.  The drawings were, I believe,
very clever, and I know the tea was delicious.
</p>

<p>
It was some time after this that the 18th Hussars were
stationed at Brighton.  Willie loved early morning gallops
on the Downs, and, on one occasion, he rode off soon after
daybreak on his steeplechaser, Early Bird, for a gallop on
the race-course.  At the early parade that morning Willie
was missing, and, as inquiries were being made as to his
whereabouts, a trooper reported that Early Bird had just
been brought in dead lame, and bleeding profusely from
a gash in the chest.
</p>

<p>
He had been found limping his way down the hill from
the race-course.  Willie's brother officers immediately set
out to look for him, and found him lying unconscious some
twenty yards from a chain across the course which was
covered with blood, and evidently the cause of the mishap.
They got him down to the barracks on a stretcher, and
there he lay with broken ribs and concussion of the brain.
</p>

<p>
He told us afterwards that he was going at a hard
gallop, and neither he nor Early Bird had seen the chain
till they were right on it, too late to jump.  There had
never been a chain up before, and he had galloped over
the same course on the previous morning.
</p>

<p>
I was at Rivenhall when I heard of the accident to
Willie, and for six unhappy weeks I did little else than
watch for news of him.  My sister, Lady Barrett-Lennard,
and Sir Thomas had gone to Preston Barracks to nurse
him, and as soon as it was possible they moved him to
their own house in Brighton.  For six weeks he lay
unconscious, and then at last the good news came that he
was better, and that they were going to take him to Belhus
to convalesce.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
</p>

<p>
A great friend of Willie's, also in the 18th&mdash;Robert
Cunninghame Graham&mdash;was invited down to keep him
amused, and my sister, Mrs. Steele, and I met them in
London and went down to Belhus with them.  Willie was
looking very ill, and was tenderly cared for by his friend
Graham.  He was too weak to speak, but, while driving to
Belhus, he slipped a ring from his finger on to mine and
pressed my hand under cover of the rugs.
</p>

<p>
Robert Cunninghame Graham, uncle of Robert Bontine
Cunninghame Graham, the Socialist writer and traveller,
walked straight into our hearts, so gay, so careful of Willie
was he, and so utterly <i>bon camarade</i>, that we seemed to
have known him for years.  In a few days Anna and I
left Belhus, and Willie's father came over from Ireland to
stay with him till he was completely recovered.
</p>

<p>
Before Willie left I was back at Belhus on the occasion
of a dinner party, and was shyly glad to meet him again
and at his desire to talk to me only.
</p>

<p>
While the others were all occupied singing and talking
after dinner we sat on the yellow damask sofa, and he
slipped a gold and turquoise locket on a long gold and blue
enamel chain round my neck.  It was a lovely thing, and I
was very happy to know how much Willie cared for me.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap02fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap02fn1text">1</a>] Captain O'Shea's family, the O'Sheas of Limerick, were a collateral
branch of the O'Sheas of County Kerry.  William O'Shea had three
sons, Henry, John and Thaddeus, of whom the first named was Captain
O'Shea's father.  John went to Spain (where a branch of the family had
been settled since 1641, and become the Duges of Sanlucas), founded a
bank and prospered.  Henry found the family estate (Rich Hill) heavily
mortgaged, entered the law, and by hard work pulled the property out
of bankruptcy and made a fortune.  He married Catherine Quinlan,
daughter of Edward Quinlan, of Tipperary, a Comtesse of Rome, and
had two children, Captain O'Shea and Mary, afterwards Lady of the
Royal Order of Theresa of Bavaria.  The children had a cosmopolitan
education, and the son went into the 18th Hussars, a keen sporting
regiment, where he spent great sums of money.  Finally, a bill for
£15,000 coming in, his father told him that his mother and sister would
have to suffer if this rate of expenditure continued.  Captain O'Shea
left the regiment just before his marriage to Miss Wood.  The Comtesse
O'Shea was a highly educated woman, assiduous in her practice of
religion, but valetudinarian and lacking a sense of humour.  Mary
O'Shea's education had left her French in all her modes of thought and
speech.  Both ladies disapproved of the engagement between Captain
O'Shea and Miss Wood.

CHAPTER III
<br />
MY FATHER'S DEATH AND MY MARRIAGE
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>Fair shine the day on the house with open door;<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The following autumn my father, mother, and I went to
stay at Belhus on a long visit, my father going to Cressing
each week for the Sunday duty, and returning to us on
Monday morning.
</p>

<p>
We all enjoyed spending Christmas at Belhus.  My
mother and my sister Emma were devoted to one another,
and loved being together.  We were a much larger party
also at Belhus, and there were so many visitors coming
and going that I felt it was all more cheerful than being
at home.
</p>

<p>
Among other visitors that winter, I well remember
Mr. John Morley&mdash;now Lord Morley&mdash;as he was told off for me
to entertain during the day.  He was a very brilliant young
man, and my elders explained to me that his tense intellect
kept them at too great a strain for pleasurable conversation.
"You, dear Katie, don't matter, as no one expects you to
know anything!" remarked my sister with cheerful
kindness.  So I calmly invited John Morley to walk with me,
and, as we paced through the park from one lodge to the
other, my companion talked to me so easily and readily
that I forgot my rôle of "fool of the family," and responded
most intelligently to a really very interesting conversation.
</p>

<p>
With the ready tact of the really clever, he could already
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
adapt himself to great or small, and finding me simply
ready to be interested, was most interesting, and I returned
to my family happily conscious that I could now afford to
ignore my brother Evelyn's advice to "look lovely and
keep your mouth shut!"
</p>

<p>
John Morley, so far as I remember him then, was a
very slight young man with a hard, keen face, the features
strongly marked, and fair hair.  He had (to me) a kindly
manner, and did not consider it beneath him to talk
seriously to a girl so young in knowledge, so excessively and
shyly conscious of his superiority, and so much awed by
my mission of keeping him amused and interested while
my elders rested from his somewhat oppressive
intellectuality.  I remember wondering, in some alarm, as to
what topic I should start if he suddenly stopped talking.
But my fear was entirely groundless; he passed so easily
from one thing interesting to me to another that I forgot
to be self-conscious, and we discussed horses and dogs,
books and their writers&mdash;agreeing that authors were, of
all men, the most disappointing in appearance&mdash;my father,
soldiers, and "going to London," with the greatest pleasure
and mutual self-confidence.  And I think that, after that
enlightening talk, had I been told that in after years this
suave, clever young man was to become&mdash;as Gladstone's
lieutenant&mdash;one of my bitterest foes, I should perhaps have
been interested, but utterly unalarmed, for I had in this
little episode lost all awe of cleverness as such.
</p>

<p>
My father died in February, 1866.  The vexed question
of ways and means&mdash;always a vexed question in a clergyman's
household when the head of the house dies&mdash;pressed
heavily on my mother, who was left almost penniless by
my father's death.
</p>

<p>
My mother and sisters were discussing what was best
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
to be done, and my mother was speaking sadly as I went
into her room.  "We must sell the cow, and, of course,
the pig," my eldest sister (Emma) replied in her sweet,
cheerful voice, which produced a little laugh, though a
rather dismal one, and our sorrow was chased away for
the moment.
</p>

<p>
My mother's sister, Mrs. Benjamin Wood, on hearing
of her troubles, settled a yearly income on her, thus saving
her from all future anxiety, most of her children being
provided for under our grandfather's&mdash;old Sir Matthew
Wood's&mdash;will.
</p>

<p>
During that year we lived chiefly at Rivenhall.  It was
a very quiet, sad year, but we had a few pleasant visitors.
Sir George Dasent, of the <i>Times</i>, and also Mr. Dallas,
who wrote leading articles for the same paper, were
frequent visitors, and Mr. Chapman (of Chapman and Hall,
publishers), with pretty Mrs. Chapman, Mr. Lewes, and
many other literary people were very welcome guests.
My mother and sister Anna (Mrs. Steele) were writing
books, and much interested in all things literary.  At the
end of the year we joined my eldest sister and her
husband at Brighton, and soon after this Willie returned
from Spain and called on us at once, with the ever-faithful
Cunninghame Graham.  I now yielded to Willie's protest
at being kept waiting longer, and we were married very
quietly at Brighton on January 25, 1867.  I narrowly
escaped being married to Mr. Cunninghame Graham by
mistake, as Willie and he&mdash;the "best man"&mdash;had got into
wrong positions.  It was only Mr. Graham's horrified
"No, no, no," when asked whether he would have "this
woman" to be his wife, that saved us from many
complications.
</p>

<p>
My mother, brothers and sisters gave me beautiful
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
presents, and my dear sister Emma gave me my trousseau,
while Willie himself gave me a gold-mounted dressing-bag.
My old Aunt H. sent me a gold and turquoise bracelet.
Willie saw this after I had shown him what my sister
Mrs. Steele had given me&mdash;a carbuncle locket with diamond
centre.  Aunt H. was a very wealthy woman, my sister
not at all well off, though in any case her present would
have been much more to me than that of Aunt H.  However,
Willie merely remarked of Anna's gift: "That is
lovely, darling, and this," taking up Aunt H.'s bracelet,
"this will do for the dog," snapped it round the neck of
my little Prince.
</p>

<p>
Long afterwards he and I went to call on Aunt H.,
and as usual I had Prince under my arm.  I noticed Aunt
H. break off in a sentence, and fix a surprised and
indignant eye on my dog.  I had forgotten all about Prince's
collar being Aunt H.'s bracelet, and only thought she did
not like my bringing the dog to call, till I caught Willie's
eye.  He had at once taken in the situation, and became
so convulsed with laughter that I hastily made my adieu
and hustled him off.
</p>

<p>
Sir Seymour Fitzgerald lent us Holbrook Hall for our
honeymoon, a kindness that proved unkind, as the pomp
and ceremony entailed by a large retinue of servants for
our two selves were very wearisome to me.  There was
little or no occupation for us, as the weather was too bad
to get out much; our kind host had naturally not lent us
his hunters, and we were, or Willie was, too much in awe
of the conventions to ask anyone to come and relieve our
ennui.  Indeed, I think that no two young people were
ever more rejoiced than we were when we could return to
the life of the sane without comment.
</p>

<p>
Willie had sold out of the army just before his marriage,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
and his Uncle John, who had married a Spanish lady and
settled in Madrid, offered Willie a partnership in his bank,
O'Shea and Co., if he would put the £4,000 he received
for his commission into it.  This was too good an offer
to be refused, so I said good-bye to my people, and bought
some little presents for the servants at home, including a
rich silk dress for my old nurse Lucy, who had been in
my mother's service since the age of sixteen, and who was
much upset that her youngest and dearest nursling should
be taken away to such "heathenish, far-off places."
</p>

<p>
Before leaving England Willie and I stayed for a few
days in London, and his mother and sister Mary called
on us.  They had not attended the marriage, as they
would not lend their countenance to a "mixed" marriage,
though once accomplished they accepted the situation.
They were very nice and kind, and so gently superior that
at once I became politely antagonistic.  They brought me
some beautiful Irish poplins which were made into gowns
to wear in Madrid to impress the Spanish cousins, and a
magnificent emerald bracelet, besides £200 worth of lovely
Irish house-linen.  My mother-in-law and sister-in-law
were most generous indeed, and I then, and always,
acknowledged them to be thoroughly good, kind-hearted
women, but so hidebound with what was to me bigotry,
with conventionality and tactlessness, that it was really a
pain to me to be near them.  They admired me, and very
plainly disapproved of me; I admired them for their
Parisian finish&mdash;(for want of a better term)&mdash;and for their
undoubted goodness, but, though I was rather fond of
Mary, they wearied me to death.
</p>

<p>
That week we crossed over to Boulogne, and there we
had to stay for a few days, as I was too ill from the
crossing to go farther.  The second morning Willie, seeing I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
was better, wanted to go out to <i>déjeuner</i>, and told me to
lie still in bed, and he would tell them to send a maid with
my food, as he knew that I, not being used to French
customs, would not like a waiter to bring it.  To make
sure of my not being disturbed he locked the door.  To
my horror half an hour after he had gone there was a tap
at the door, and a manservant opened it with his key, and
marched in, despite my agitated protests in very
home-made French.  Once in, however, he made me so
comfortable by his deft arrangement of a most tempting meal
and paternal desire that "Madame should eat and recover
herself," that I was able to laugh at Willie's annoyance
on his return to find the waiter once more in possession and
removing the tray.
</p>

<p>
We then went to Paris to stay with my mother-in-law
and Mary for a few days, while they found me a French
maid and showed me the sights.  I had a great quantity
of very long hair in those days, and Willie insisted on my
having it very elaborately dressed&mdash;much to my annoyance&mdash;in
the latest French fashion, which I did not consider
becoming to me.  My maid was also much occupied in
making the toilet of my little dog.  He was a lovely little
creature, and Caroline would tie an enormous pale blue
bow on him as a reward for the painful business of combing
him.  From the time Willie gave me this little dog to the
day it died, about six years afterwards, it went everywhere
with me.  He was as good and quiet as possible when
with me, but if I ever left him for a moment the shrill little
howls would ring out till the nearest person to him would
snatch him up, and fly to restore him to his affectionate,
though long-suffering, mistress.
</p>

<p>
At Paris there was trouble with my mother-in-law and
Mary at once because of him.  They took me to see Notre
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
Dame, and as a matter of course Prince was in my arm
under my cloak.  As we came out I let my little dog down
to run, and the Comtesse nearly fainted.  "You took the
dog into the <i>church</i>!  Oh, Katie, how wrong, how could,
you!  Mary! what shall we do?  Do you not think&mdash;&mdash;?"
and turning a reproachful glance on me, Mary responded,
"Come, mother," and, leaving me amazed and indignant
on the steps, they passed into Notre Dame again.  With
some curiosity I peeped in after them, and beheld them
kneeling at prayer just inside the door.  They came out
almost at once, and the old Comtesse looked happier.
"You did not understand, dear," said Mary kindly, "it
is better not to take the little dog into a church."  I was
young enough to resent being told I did not understand,
and promptly returned, "I understand, Mary, that you
and the Comtesse consider it wicked to take Prince into
Notre Dame.  Well, I don't, and you must excuse me if
I remind you that God made the dog; and I seem to
remember something about a Child that was born in a
stable with a lot of nice friendly beasts about, so you need
not have gone back to pray about me and Prince, I think!"  And,
scooping up Prince, I stalked off with a dignity that
was rather spoilt by my not having sufficient French to
find my own way home, and having to wait at the carriage
for them.  We drove home with much stiffness, and only
thawed sufficiently to assure Willie how much we had
enjoyed ourselves!
</p>

<p>
While I was abroad I often used to get away by myself
to spend many happy hours in the beautiful churches with
Prince tucked under my arm, and often a friendly old
priest would give us a smile as he passed on his way about
the church, so it was apparently not a very deadly sin to
take him with me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
</p>

<p>
Willie's mother and Mary became more reconciled to
the little dog when they found how much admired he was
in Paris.  An old Frenchman, after seeing him one
evening as Willie and I were leaving table d'hôte, made
inquiries as to where we were staying, and called on Willie
to offer £100 for "madame's pet" if at any time she wished
to sell him.  Willie was too wise to approach me with the
offer, and assured monsieur that madame would consider
the offer an insult only to be wiped out in monsieur's
blood!

CHAPTER IV
<br />
A DAY ON THE DOWNS
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>A son to clasp my finger tight.</i>"&mdash;NORMAN GALE.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When we had been in Spain for nearly a year, there was
some dispute about the business arrangements of Willie's
partnership in his uncle's bank, and Willie withdrew
altogether from the affair.  We then decided to return to
England.  Though glad to go home, I parted from my
Spanish relations with regret, and have always since my
visit to them thought that the admixture of Irish and
Spanish blood is most charming in its result.
</p>

<p>
On our return to England we lived in Clarges Street,
London, for some time, while Willie was looking for a
place in the country where he could start a stud farm.
Willie was very fond of horses, and understood them well,
and I was delighted at the idea of his getting some really
good brood mares and breeding race-horses.  We knew,
of course, nothing of the enormous expense and many losses
such an undertaking was certain to entail.
</p>

<p>
At last we decided to take Bennington Park, Hertfordshire,
and on going there Willie bought some good blood
stock, among the pick of which were Alice Maud, Scent,
and Apricot.  Soon we had all the boxes tenanted, and
I spent many happy hours petting the lovely thoroughbred
mares with their small velvety noses and intelligent eyes.
</p>

<p>
The chief form of social intercourse in the county was
the giving of long, heavy, and most boring dinners.
People thought nothing of driving eight or even ten miles
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
(and there were no motor-cars then) to eat their dinner in
each other's houses, and this form of entertainment used
to produce such an absolutely painful boredom in me that
I frequently hid the invitations from Willie, who wished
to "keep up with the county."
</p>

<p>
Willie and I were a good-looking young couple, and
people liked to have us about.  Willie, too, was a good
conversationalist, and had a ready wit that made him
welcome, since an Irishman and wit are synonymous to the
conventional mind.  That his witticisms pertained rather
to the France of his education than the Ireland of his
birth was unrecognized because unexpected.
</p>

<p>
I was&mdash;rather, I fear, to Willie's annoyance&mdash;labelled
"delightfully unusual" soon after our going to Bennington,
the cause being that I received my guests one evening
with my then abundant hair hanging loosely to below my
waist, twisted through with a wide blue ribbon.  To
Willie's scandalized glance I replied with a hasty whisper,
"The very latest from Paris," and was rewarded with the
mollified though puzzled expression very properly awarded
by all men to the "latest fashion" of their womenkind.
</p>

<p>
I put off the queries of the ladies after dinner in the
same way, and was rewarded by them by the general
admission that it was a fashion for the few&mdash;who had the
hair.  Never did I admit that I had been out with the
horses so late that I had had just time for Caroline to hurry
me into a gown and shake down my hair as my first guest
arrived.  So little do we deserve the fame forced upon us.
</p>

<p>
Willie was never good at dunning friends for money
owed, and as we had many brood mares, not our own,
left with us for months at a time, the stable expenses,
both for forage and wages, became appallingly large.  It
was always difficult to get the accounts in, and while Willie
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
did not like to worry the owners even for the amount for
the bare keep of the animals, he was himself perpetually
worried by forage contractors, the shoeing smith, and the
weekly wage bill, besides the innumerable extra expenses
pertaining to a large stable.
</p>

<p>
As I urged against the sale of the mares, which he so
often threatened, their happy, peaceful maternity, in the
long lush grass and shade of trees by day, their comfortable
boxes at night, and their fondness of me, he used to stare
gloomily at me and swear gently as he wished there were
more profit than peace in their maternity and my
sentimentality.  But he could forget his worries in the pleasure
of schooling the yearlings, and we agreed always to hold
on as long as possible to a life we both found so interesting,
and with the facile hope of youth we thought to get the
better of our expenses in time.
</p>

<p>
In this year (1869) my eldest (surviving) brother,
Frank, became very ill, and Willie and I went to Rivenhall
to see him.  He wanted me to nurse him, so I stayed on
in my old home while Willie returned to Bennington.
</p>

<p>
Frank had consumption, and very badly; he suffered
intensely, and I think I have never longed for the presence
of a doctor with more anxiety than I did for Dr. Gimson's
at that time.  My perpetual fear was that the effect of the
opiate he gave to deaden poor Frank's pain would
wear off before he came again.  When it grew dusk
Frank desired me to put candles in every window, that
he might not see the shadows&mdash;the terrifying shadows
which delirium and continual doses of morphia never fail
to produce.
</p>

<p>
Frank's very dear friend, Captain Hawley Smart, the
novelist, came to Rivenhall in the hope that he could cheer
poor Frank's last hours; but he was too ill to know or care,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
and Hawley Smart could, like the rest of us, only await the
pitying release of death.
</p>

<p>
We went on at Bennington in very much the same
way until the end of that year.  Willie had been betting
very heavily in the hope of relieving the ever-increasing
difficulty of meeting our heavy expenses, and now, in
view of his losses in racing added to the cost attendant
on keeping up such a large stud, the kind-hearted bank
manager insisted that the large overdraft on his bank must
be cleared.  Hitherto, whenever he had become very
pressing, Willie had sent him "something on account," and
we had given a breakfast for his hunt, as Willie said such
a good fellow "could not eat and ask at the same time."  Now,
however, Mr. Cheshire sorrowfully declined to eat,
and maintained that his duty to his firm necessitated his
insisting upon the clearing of the overdraft.
</p>

<p>
When Willie was made bankrupt, Mr. Hobson&mdash;a
gentleman living near us with his very charming wife, who
afterwards became Mrs. A. Yates&mdash;very kindly took my
little old pony across the fields at night to his own place
and kept him there so that he should not go into the sale
of our goods.  This defrauded no one, as the pony (my
own) was beyond work, being my childhood's pet.
</p>

<p>
I was now nearing my first confinement, and my aunt,
Mrs. Benjamin Wood, took a house for me at Brighton
close to my sister's, Lady Barrett-Lennard.  There my
son Gerard was born.
</p>

<p>
I was very ill for some time after this, and my mother,
Lady Wood, stayed with me, employing her time in
making a lovely water-colour sketch for me.
</p>

<p>
Willie's affairs were now settled, and I had to give up
all hope of returning to my dearly loved country home and
all my pets; but I had the consolation of my beautiful babe,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
and I forgot my sorrow in my greater possession.  He was
very healthy, so I had no trouble on that score.
</p>

<p>
A young solicitor who took Willie's affairs in hand,
Mr. Charles Lane (of Lane and Monroe), very kindly took
upon himself to call on my Uncle William, who was then
Lord Chancellor of England, and ask him to assist us in
our financial difficulties.  Uncle William was much
astonished at the application of this obviously nervous young
solicitor, who with the courage born of despair went on to
suggest that Lord Hatherley might give Willie a lucrative
appointment.
</p>

<p>
Strangely enough it had never occurred to me to apply
to Uncle William for anything, and when Mr. Lane called
on us and solemnly presented me with a substantial cheque
and a kind message from my uncle, Willie and I were as
surprised as we were pleased, even though Mr. Lane
explained that "the Lord Chancellor had no post suitable"
for Willie's energies.
</p>

<p>
We then moved into a house on the Marine Parade,
as the one we were in was very expensive, and though I
was glad to be next door to my sister, I felt it was not
fair to my aunt, Mrs. Wood, who was paying the rent
for us.
</p>

<p>
My faithful French maid Caroline stuck to us all
through our fallen fortunes, as also did our stud-groom,
Selby, and though we could no longer pay them the high
wages they had always had, they refused to leave us.
</p>

<p>
My aunt now took a cottage for me at Patcham, just
put of Brighton, and I was able to have my pony there.
The house at Patcham was a dear, little, old-fashioned
place right against the Downs, and there I used to walk
for miles in the early morning, the springy turf almost
forcing one foot after the other, while the song of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
larks and scent of the close-growing, many-tinted herbage
in the clear bright air filled me with joyous exhilaration.
</p>

<p>
Willie went to town, and often was away for days, on
various businesses, and I was very lonely at home&mdash;even
though I daily drove the old pony into Brighton that I
might see my sister.
</p>

<p>
I had a cousin of Willie's, Mrs. Vaughan, to stay with
me for some time, but she was perpetually wondering what
Willie was doing that kept him so much away, and this
added irritation to loneliness.  I had had such a busy life
at Bennington that I suffered much from the want of
companionship and the loss of the many interests of my life
there.  I felt that I must make some friends here, and,
attracted by a dark, handsome woman whom I used to meet
riding when I walked on to the Downs, I made her
acquaintance, and found in her a very congenial companion.
Quiet and rather tragic in expression, she thawed to me,
and we were becoming warmly attached to one another
when Willie, in one of his now flying visits, heard me
speak of my new friend.  On hearing her name&mdash;it was
one that a few years before had brought shame and sudden
death into one of the oldest of the "great" families of
England&mdash;he professed to be absolutely scandalized, and,
with an assumption of authority that at once angered me,
forbade me to have any more to do with her.  He met my
protests with a maddening superiority, and would not tell
me why she was "beyond the pale."  I explained to him
my own opinion of many of the women he liked me to know
and almost all the men, for I had not then learnt the hard
lesson of social life, and that the one commandment still
rigorously observed by social hypocrisy was, "Thou shalt
not be found out."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
</p>

<p>
When I met Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; again she soothed my indignation
on her behalf, and as we sat there, high on a spur of
a hill, watching the distant sea, she smiled a little sadly
as she said to me: "Little fool, I have gambled in love
and have won, and those who win must pay as well as
those who lose.  Never gamble, you very young thing,
if you can help it; but if you do be sure that the stake
is the only thing in the world to you, for only that will
make it worth the winning and the paying."
</p>

<p>
It was nearly ten years afterwards that I, feeling restless
and unhappy, had such a sudden longing for the sea, that
one morning I left my home (at Eltham) very early and
went down to Brighton for the day.  I was alone, and
wished to be alone; so I got out of the train at Preston,
for fear I should meet any of my relations at Brighton
station.  A fancy then seized me to drive out to Patcham,
about a mile farther on, to see if my former little house
was occupied.  Having decided that it was I dismissed
my fly and walked up the bridle path beyond the
house out on to the Downs, where, turning south,
towards the sea, I walked steadily over the scented turf,
forcing out of my heart all but the joy of movement
in the sea wind, with the song of the skylarks in my
ears.
</p>

<p>
I sang as I walked, looking towards the golden light
and sullen blue of the sea, where a storm was beating up
with the west wind.  Presently I realized that I was very
tired, and I sat down to rest upon a little hilltop where I
could see over the whole of Brighton.  The wind brought
up the rain, and I rose and began to descend the hill
towards Brighton.  I wondered apathetically if my sister
was in Brighton or if they were all at Belhus still.
Anyhow, I knew there would be someone at her house who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
would give me something to eat.  Then I turned round,
and began deliberately to climb up the hill on to the
Downs again.  After all, I thought, I had come here to
be alone, and did not want to see my sister particularly.
The family might all be there, and anyhow I did not want
to see anybody who loved me and could bias my mind.
I had come down to get away from Willie for a little
while&mdash;or rather from the thought of him, for it was rarely
enough I saw him.  If I went down to see Emma and
Tom they would ask how Willie was, and really I did not
know, and then how were the children.  Well, I could
thankfully answer that the children were always well.  Why
should I be supposed to have no other interests than Willie
and my children?  Willie was not, as a matter of fact, at
all interesting to me.  As to my children, I loved them
very dearly, but they were not old enough, or young
enough, to engross my whole mind.  Then there was dear
old Aunt Ben, who was so old that she would not tolerate
any topic of conversation of more recent date than the
marriage of Queen Victoria.  What a curiously narrow
life mine was, I thought, narrow, narrow, narrow, and so
deadly dull.  It was better even to be up there on the
Downs in the drifting rain&mdash;though I was soaked to the
skin and so desperately tired and hungry.  I paused for
shelter behind a shepherd's hut as I saw the lithe spare
form of my brother-in-law, Sir Thomas, dash past, head
down and eyes half closed against the rain.  He did not
see me, and I watched him running like a boy through the
driving mist till he disappeared.  He had come over from
Lewes, I supposed.  He was a J.P., and had perhaps been
over to the court; he never rode where he could walk&mdash;or
rather run.
</p>

<p>
I waited, sheltering now from the rain, and through the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
mist there presently came a girl riding.  On seeing me
she pulled up to ask the quickest way to Brighton, as the
mist had confused her.  As I answered her I was struck
by a certain resemblance, in the dark eyes and proud tilt
of the chin, to my friend of many years ago, whose battles
I had fought with Willie, and who had told me something
of her life while we sat very near this place.  The girl now
before me was young, and life had not yet written any
bitterness upon her face; but as she thanked me, and,
riding away, laughingly urged me to give up the attempt
to "keep dry," and to fly home before I dissolved
altogether, I had the voice of my old-time friend in my ears,
and I answered aloud, "I am afraid; I tell you, I am
afraid."  But she was dead, I knew, and could not answer
me, and I smiled angrily at my folly as I turned down the
track to Preston, while I thought more quietly how the
daughter whose loss had caused such bitter pain to my dear
friend, when she had left all for love, had grown to happy
womanhood in spite of all.
</p>

<p>
I was now feeling very faint from my long day of hard
exercise without food, but there was a train about to start
for London, and I would not miss it.
</p>

<p>
On the platform for Eltham, at Charing Cross, stood
Mr. Parnell, waiting, watching the people as they passed
the barriers.  As our eyes met he turned and walked by
my side.  He did not speak, and I was too tired to do so,
or to wonder at his being there.  He helped me into the
train and sat down opposite me, and I was too exhausted
to care that he saw me wet and dishevelled.  There were
others in the carriage.  I leant back and closed my eyes,
and could have slept but that the little flames deep down
in Parnell's eyes kept flickering before mine, though they
were closed.  I was very cold; and I felt that he took off
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
his coat and tucked it round me, but I would not open my
eyes to look at him.  He crossed over to the seat next to
mine, and, leaning over me to fold the coat more closely
round my knees, he whispered, "I love you, I love you.
Oh, my dear, how I love you."  And I slipped my hand
into his, and knew I was not afraid.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Willie was away more than ever after this, and I became
so bored and lonely that I told him that I must join him
in London if he meant to be there so much.  He then
proposed to give up the Patcham house and move the small
household to Harrow Road, London, temporarily, till we
had time to find something less depressing.
</p>

<p>
In going we also hoped to shake off an acquaintance
who haunted us at Brighton and Patcham, a Mr. D., but
he soon found us out, and, realizing that I was determined
to be "not at home" to him, he took to leaving gifts of
beautiful Spanish lace at the door, directed to me, and
only the words "from Romeo" inside.
</p>

<p>
This man had lived most of his life in Spain, and was
a remarkably good judge of Spanish lace, and I must
confess I was tempted to keep the rich creamy-white stuff
that arrived anonymously.  This "Romeo" was more than
middle-aged, and, when he wrote that for "safety's sake"
he would address messages to me through the "agony"
column of the newspapers, Willie's wrath was unbounded.
</p>

<p>
He wrote to poor "Romeo" in sarcastic vein, alluding
to his age and figure, his insolence in addressing "a young
and beautiful" woman with his "pestilent" twaddle.  He
told him, too, that he withdrew from all business transactions
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
with him, and would have much pleasure in kicking
"Romeo" if he dared call at the house again.  I was
almost sorry for the foolish old man; but that was wasted
on him, for he continued, undeterred by Willie's anger,
to address "Juliet" in prose and verse in the daily papers.
As he said, the "Daily Press was open to all, and the
Captain could not stop that!"  I used to laugh helplessly
as Willie opened the morning paper at breakfast, and,
first gravely turning to the "agony" column, would read
the latest message to "Juliet" from her devoted "Romeo,"
becoming so angry that breakfast was spoiled to him.  The
sudden cessation of our acquaintance prevented our making
that of Mme. Adelina Patti though "Romeo" had
arranged a dinner in order that I should meet her.
</p>

<p>
A few weeks after we arrived in Harrow Road Willie
began to complain of feeling ill, and a swelling that had
formed on his neck became very painful.  He was confined
to bed, and after great suffering for weeks, Mr. Edgar
Barker, who was constantly in attendance, said he must
operate to save Willie's life.  I had no nurse, as at this
time we were in such financial straits that I really did not
know which way to turn, and Willie was too ill to be asked
about anything.  Mr. Barker said to me, "You must hold
his head perfectly still, and not faint."  So he operated,
and all went well, in spite of my inexperience in surgical
nursing.  Mr. Barker, for whose kindness at this time I
can never be sufficiently grateful, helped me in every way,
and would not allow even Willie's mother and sister to
do so, as their presence irritated the patient so intensely.
</p>

<p>
During this time of trouble a Mr. Calasher, a money-lender,
called to have some acceptances of Willie's met.
I left Willie's bedside for a few minutes to see him, and
he was kindness itself, agreeing to a renewal on my signature
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
alone, and most kindly sending in some little delicacies
that he thought Willie might fancy.  When Willie had
recovered and went to see Mr. Calasher about the bills,
it being then more than ever impossible to meet them, he
(Mr. Calasher) would not consent to a further renewal, but
tore the bills across and gave them back to Willie, saying,
"Don't worry yourself, Captain O'Shea, but pay me when
you can, and add six per cent. interest if you are able."  I
am glad to say we did this within the year.  His courtesy
about these bills was a great relief to me, as Willie was
far too ill to be spoken to about business, and I was at
my wits' end for money to meet everyday expenses.  The
accommodating Jew who lends the indiscreet Christian his
money&mdash;naturally with a businesslike determination to
increase it&mdash;has so much said against him that I am glad to
be able to speak my little word of gratitude of one who
was considerate and chivalrous to Willie as well as myself,
to his own detriment.
</p>

<p>
Better circumstances arising on Willie's recovery of
health, we were anxious to get away from the depressions
of Harrow Road, with its constant procession of hearses
and mourners on the way to Kensal Green Cemetery.
After a weary hunt we finally decided upon a house in
Beaufort Gardens.  My French maid rejoiced in returning
to her light duties as lady's maid, and reigned over a staff
of maids in unison with the butler.  Selby, at last
convinced that race-horses were out of the question with us,
left us, with mutual expressions of esteem, to seek more
congenial surroundings.
</p>

<p>
We went to Beaufort Gardens in 1872, and Willie
insisted upon my making many new acquaintances.  We
soon found ourselves in a social swirl of visits, visitors and
entertainments.  I had always disliked society, as such.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
Willie, however, thoroughly enjoyed this life, and as he
was always worrying me to dress in the latest fashion, and
would have a Frenchman in to dress my hair before every
party, I became very rebellious.
</p>

<p>
Here my eldest daughter was born, and I was glad of
the rest from parties and balls&mdash;even though so many
people I did not care to see came "to cheer me up!"  As
soon as I was about again the life I found so wearisome
recommenced.  After escorting me home from a dance or
reception that I had not wanted to go to, Willie would go
off again to "finish up the night," and one night, when in
terror I was seeking for burglars, I found a policeman
sitting on the stairs.  He explained genially that the door
was open, and he thought it better to come inside and
guard the door for the Captain's return!
</p>

<p>
Alfred Austin&mdash;not then Poet Laureate&mdash;was a great
friend and constant visitor of ours at that time.  He had
been at school&mdash;at Oscott&mdash;with Willie, and he was, I
remember, extremely sensitive to criticism.  "Owen Meredith,"
Lord Lytton, was also a frequent visitor, especially
when my sister Anna was with us&mdash;she being sympathetic
to his genius.
</p>

<p>
I think Willie and I were beginning to jar upon one
another a good deal now, and I loved to get away for long
walks by myself through the parks of London.  Kensington
Gardens was a great solace to me in all seasons and
weathers, and I spent much of my time there.  I often
turned into the Brompton Oratory on my way home for
a few minutes' peace and rest of body and soul, and these
quiet times were a comfort to me when suffering from the
fret and worry of my domestic life.
</p>

<p>
I first made my way to the Oratory when my daughter
Norah was baptized, and some little time afterwards one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
of the Fathers called on me.  Finally Father &mdash;&mdash; undertook
to call regularly to instruct me in the Catholic religion.
He and the other priests lent me any books I wanted, and
"The Threshold of the Catholic Faith," and one other I
have now.  That I never got beyond the "Threshold"
was no fault of these good Fathers, who taught me with
endless patience and uncompromising directness.  But I
had before me two types of Catholic in Willie and his
mother and sister, and both were to me stumbling-blocks.
The former was, as I knew, what they call a "careless
Catholic," and I thought that if he who had been born in
that faith that means so much made so little of it, perhaps
it was more of a beautiful dream than a reality of life.
Yet when I turned and considered those "good Catholics,"
his mother and sister, I found such a fierce bigotry and
deadly dullness of outlook, such an immense piety and so
small a charity, that my whole being revolted against such
a belittling of God-given life.  Now, I know that Mary
and the Comtesse disliked me personally, and also that my
temperament was antagonistic to theirs, as indeed to
Willie's, though the affection he and I had for one another
eased the friction between us; but youth judges so much
by results, and my excursion into the Catholic religion
ended in abrupt revolt against all forms and creeds.  This
feeling was intensified when my second little girl, Carmen,
was born and christened at the Oratory.  I would not go
in, but stood waiting in the porch, where I had so often
marked tired men and women passing in to pray after
their hard and joyless day of toil, and I felt that my
children were taken from me, and that I was very lonely.
</p>

<p>
My Uncle William, Lord Hatherley, was Lord High
Chancellor at this time, and we were a good deal at his
house, both at "functions" and privately.  His great
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
friend, Dean Stanley, was very kind to me; Dean Hook
came, too, and many other Churchmen were continually
in and out in their train.  My cousin, William Stephens,
who afterwards became Dean of Winchester, was then a
very good-looking and agreeable young man; he followed
my uncle about like a shadow, and my uncle and Aunt
Charlotte were devoted to him.  But my uncle gathered
other society than that of Churchmen about him, and it
amused me to watch for the pick of the intellectual world
of the day as they swarmed up and down the stairs at the
receptions, with the necessary make-weight of people who
follow and pose in the wake of the great.
</p>

<p>
Willie insisted upon his wife being perfectly gowned
on these occasions, and as he so often got out of going to
those functions and insisted on my going alone, certain
other relations of Lord Hatherley's would hover round me
with their spiteful remarks of: "Dear Katie, alone again I
poor dear girl, where does he go?  How odd that you are
so often alone&mdash;how little you know!"  I was fond of my
old uncle and he of me, but these little amenities did not
make me like these social functions better, especially as his
wife, my Aunt Charlotte, had a most irritating habit of
shutting her eyes when greeting me, and, with her head
slightly to one side, saying, "Poor dear!  Poor lovely
lamb!"
</p>

<p>
This winter, following the birth of my second girl, was
bitterly cold, and my health, which had not been good for
some time before her birth, caused much anxiety.  After
a consultation between Sir William Gull, Sir William
Jenner, and my usual doctor, it was decided that we should
go to Niton, Isle of Wight, as I was too weak to travel far.
My dear old aunt, Mrs. Benjamin Wood, sent her own
doctor to me, and he recommended me to inject opium&mdash;an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
expression of opinion that horrified Sir William Jenner
into saying, "That man's mad, or wants to get rid of
you!"
</p>

<p>
Our pecuniary affairs were again causing us considerable
anxiety, but my dear aunt played the fairy godmother
once more, and sent Willie a cheque so that we could go
to Niton without worry or anxiety, and stop there until
my health should be re-established.  We were delighted
with the summer warmth of the sun, and spent a happy
Christmas basking in it.  Since the hotel was very
expensive, Willie established me in lodgings with the
children and nurses in Ventnor, and, finding the place
decidedly dull, returned to London.
</p>

<p>
The local doctor at Ventnor, who had been put in charge
of my shattered health, was not satisfied that it was in any
way improving, and, finding one day that I was in the
habit of taking sleeping draughts, he snorted angrily off
to the chemist and returned with a large tin of meat extract,
with which he presented me, adding the intimation that
it was worth a dozen bottles of my draught&mdash;which
happened to be a powder&mdash;and that my London doctors
were bereft of intelligence.  I was too tired to argue the
point and contented myself with the observation that all
doctors save the one in attendance were fellows in
intelligence&mdash;a sentiment he considered suspiciously for
some moments before snorting away like the amiable little
steam engine he was.  His specific for sleeplessness was
much more wholesome than drugs, and I have always
found it so since then.

<br />
CAPTAIN O'SHEA ENTERS POLITICAL LIFE
</h3>

  "<i>D'un coeur qui t'aime,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mon Dieu, qui peut troubler la tranquille paix?<br />
  Il cherche, en tout, ta volunté suprème,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Et ne se cherche jamais.<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Willie was too busy to come down to Ventnor again, and
I became so depressed by the relaxing air and by the sight
of the many poor consumptive people I met at every turn,
veritable signposts in their different stages of disease of
the road I had been warned that I was on, that I decided
to go nearer home.  My doctor suggested Hastings, and
there I went, taking my small family under the kindly
escort of one of my nephews.
</p>

<p>
Willie soon came down, and, as my health improved
rapidly, we stayed on for some time, making frequent
visits to my Aunt "Ben" at Eltham, who was making our
stay at the seaside possible.  This was practically my first
introduction to my aunt, as my former visits were when,
as a little child, I was only allowed to sit by her side in
the "tapestry room" trying to do some needlework under
her supervision, and assisting her in the consumption of
the luscious peaches she always had on the table.  In those
days I would have been wild with terror at the idea of
being left alone with this aunt, who always wore the
fashions of her early Victorian youth, and who would not
tolerate the slightest noise in the house.  I now found her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
of fascinating interest, and even the painful sense of
"hush" in her house, the noiseless stepping of the servants
and the careful seclusion of sunlight had attractions
for me.  My uncle, Benjamin Wood, had died very many
years before, and my aunt never alluded to him.  She
herself had never left Eltham since his death, and had only
once been in a railway train, living in complete seclusion
in her fine old Georgian house, only "taking the air" in
the grounds adjoining or emerging forth in her chariot to
drive for an hour daily.
</p>

<p>
She lived in the intellectual world of the Greek poets,
and of Addison, Swift and Racine; and there was a leisure
and a scholarly atmosphere about her life that seemed to
banish the hurry and turmoil of the modern world at her
gate.  She was extremely generous in subscribing to what
she termed "Organizations for the better conduct of charitable
relief," and, though of no particular religious belief,
she subscribed to the various objects of local charity when
asked to do so by the clergyman of the parish.  The latter
gentleman once made the mistake of offering to read the
Scriptures to her on the occasion of an illness, and I well
remember his face of consternation when she replied: "I
thank you, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, but I am still well able to read, and
the Scriptures do not interest me."  Yet during the many
years I spent in constant companionship with her the
quiet peace which reigned by her side gave me the most
restful and soothing hours of my life.
</p>

<p>
After we had paid her several visits in this way she
informed me that she had ascertained that I was much
alone, that she was very tenderly attached to me, and would
wish to provide for me and my children if I would come
to live near her so that I could be her constant companion.
She added that she considered that this arrangement would
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
be more "seemly" for me, as Willie was obliged to be
away from home so much.
</p>

<p>
After consultation with the (county court) judge,
Gordon Whitbread, her nephew and my cousin, who
always transacted her business for her, she bought a house
for me at the other side of her park, and arranged to settle
a regular income on me and to educate my children.  In
return she asked that her "Swan"&mdash;as she always called
me&mdash;should be her daily companion.  This I was until her
death, at the age of ninety-four, about fifteen years later.
</p>

<p>
My aunt lived a life of great seclusion, and, with the
exception of George Meredith (the author), and the
Rev. &mdash;&mdash; Wilkinson, who each came down once a week to read
to her, her oculist and great friend, Dr. Bader, and two
old ladies, friends of her youth, she rarely saw anyone.
Her house&mdash;"The Lodge," Eltham&mdash;was fine old Georgian,
spoilt inside by the erection of mock pillars in the hall.
She was very particular that no one should tread upon
the highly polished floors, and, as the two large halls
had only rugs laid about on the shining surface, one had
either to make many "tacks" to reach the desired door or
seat, or take a short cut on tiptoe and risk her
"displeasure."
</p>

<p>
It was amusing to watch George Meredith on his excursion
from the front door to the dressing-room at the foot
of the stairs, where my aunt kept three pairs of slippers
for the use of her "gentlemen readers" lest their boots
should soil the carpets.  To reach this little room he
had&mdash;if in a good mood and conforming to his old friend's
regulations&mdash;to walk straight ahead past the room, and
make a detour round a pillar of (imitation) green marble
and a table, back to the door.  On days of rebellion
against these forms and ceremonies he would hesitate for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
a moment just inside the door, and, with a reckless
uplifting of his head, begin a hasty stride across the sacred
places; a stride which became an agitated tip-toeing under
the scandalized gaze of the footman.  Before he began
to read to my aunt the following dialogue invariably took
place:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Now, my dear lady, I will read you something of
my own."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, my dear Mr. Meredith, I cannot comprehend
your works."
</p>

<p>
"I will explain my meaning, dear Mrs. Wood."
</p>

<p>
"You are prodigiously kind, dear Mr. Meredith, but
I should prefer Molière to-day."
</p>

<p>
While Willie and I were still living in London we went
down one day to see a furnished house we wished to rent
for a few weeks, and, remembering my Aunt Ben's injunction
to convey her "felicitations to her dear Mr. Meredith,"
we called on him.
</p>

<p>
I had not before met George Meredith, and had only
read one of his works&mdash;and that "behind the door" when
I was very young, owing to some belated scruple of my
elders.  I remember, as we neared the house, asking Willie
the names of Meredith's other works, so that I might be
ready primed with intelligent interest, and Willie's
sarcastic little smile, as he mentioned one or two, adding,
"You need not worry yourself; Meredith will soon
enlighten us as to his books.  They say it's the one thing
he ever talks about."  But we spent a delightful afternoon
with Mr. Meredith, who showed us all his literary treasures
and the little house at the end of the garden where he wrote.
While we sat in the lovely little garden drinking tea our
host descanted on the exquisite haze of heat that threw
soft shadows about the house and gave the great trees
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
in the background the appearance of an enchanted forest.
George Meredith was "reader" to Chapman and Hall in
those days, and he spoke to me appreciatively of the work
of my mother and sister, who published with Chapman
and Hall.
</p>

<p>
In these days at Eltham I learnt to know George
Meredith very well, as I saw him almost every week when
he came down to read to my aunt.  The old lady did not
like triangular conversation, so as soon as they were fairly
launched in reading or conversation, I would gladly slip
away to my own occupations.  To Aunt Ben, Meredith
appeared to be a very young man indeed, and in her
gentle, high-bred way she loved to tease him about his
very great appreciation of his own work&mdash;and person.
Meredith took her gentle raillery absolutely in good part
and would hold forth upon what the literary world "of all
time" owed him in his books, and also upon what Lady
This-or-that had said in admiration of his good looks at
such-and-such a gathering.  My aunt used to delight in
these tales, which were delivered in the mock serious
manner of a boy telling his mother of his prowess, real
or imagined; and after a time of listening to him, with
only her gently modulated little bursts of laughter to
encourage him, she would say, "Oh, my dear Mr.
Meredith, your conceit is as wonderful as your
genius!"&mdash;bringing forth from him the protest, "My dear lady, no!
But it is a pleasure to you to hear of my successes and
to me to tell you of them."  And so I would leave them
to their playful badinage and reading.
</p>

<p>
Meredith was very fond of his old friend, and always
treated her with the chivalrous and rather elaborate courtesy
that he well knew she delighted in.  His weekly visits
were a great pleasure to her, and although she would not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
allow him to read anything modern and never anything
of his own work, I think he must have enjoyed his reading
and talk with this clever old lady, for often the stipulated
two hours of the "classics and their discussion" lengthened
into the three or four that caused him to miss all the
most convenient trains home.
</p>

<p>
One evening as I was going into the house I saw him
standing on the terrace gazing after the retreating form
of my little girl Carmen, then about six years old.  As I
came up he pointed at the stiff little back and said, "She
was flying along like a fairy Atalanta when I caught her,
and said, 'What is your name?'  'Miss Nothin'-at-all!'
she replied, with such fierce dignity that I dropped her
in alarm."
</p>

<p>
I called the child to come back and speak politely
to Mr. Meredith, but, to his amusement, was only
rewarded by an airy wave of the hand as she fled down
a by-path.
</p>

<p>
As I sometimes chatted to Mr. Meredith on his way
through the grounds to the station, he would tell me of
"that blessed woman," as he used to call his (second)
wife, already then dead, and of how he missed her kind
and always sympathetic presence on his return home and
in his work.  Sometimes the handsome head would droop,
and I thought he looked careworn and sad as he spoke of
her, and in doing so he lost for the moment all the
mannerisms and "effectiveness" which were sometimes rather
wearisome in him.  As my aunt grew very old she&mdash;in
the last few years of her life&mdash;became unequal to listening
and talking to her "gentlemen readers," and to me she
deputed the task of telling them so.  In the case of George
Meredith it was rather painful to me, as I feared the loss
of the £300 a year my aunt had so long paid him for his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
weekly visits might be a serious one to him.  But he, too,
had aged in all these years, and perhaps his visits to his
old friend were becoming rather irksome to him in their
regularity.  Curiously enough, I shared my aunt's
inability to enjoy his work, and to the last I met his mocking
inquiry as to my "progress in literature" (i.e. his novels)
by a deprecating "Only 'Richard Feverel.'"
</p>

<p>
The house my aunt bought for me was just across her
park, and she had a gate made in the park fence so that
I might go backwards and forwards to her house more
quickly.  My house was a comfortable villa with the usual
little "front garden" and larger one in the rear.  There
were excellent stables at the end of this garden.  The
house, "Wonersh Lodge," had the usual dining-room and
drawing-room, with two other sitting-rooms opening
severally into the garden, and a large conservatory, which I
afterwards made over to Mr. Parnell for his own use.  My
aunt furnished the house, and we were most comfortable,
while my children rejoiced in having the run of the park
and grounds after the restraint of town life.
</p>

<p>
Willie was very much in London now, and occupied
himself in getting up a company to develop some mining
business in Spain.  He always drew up a prospectus
excellently; on reading it one could hardly help believing&mdash;as
he invariably did&mdash;that here at last was the golden
opportunity of speculators.  Some influential men put into
the Spanish venture sums varying from £1,000 to
£10,000.  Our old friend Christopher Weguelin took
great interest in it, and eventually Willie was offered
the post of manager, at La Mines, at a good salary.  It
was a very acceptable post to Willie, as he loved the life
in foreign countries.  There was a very good house, and
he had it planted round with eucalyptus trees to keep off the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
fever so prevalent there, and from which the men working
the mines suffered greatly.
</p>

<p>
Willie was, however, immune to fever, and never had
it.  He was away in Spain for over eighteen months this
time, and did not come home at all during the period.
</p>

<p>
My son now, at eight years old, proved too much for
his French governess, so we arranged for him to go to a
school at Blackheath, though he was two years younger
than the age generally accepted there.  The little girls
were started afresh with a German governess, and on
Willie's return from Spain he stayed at Eltham for a
time.
</p>

<p>
We were pleased to see one another again, but once
more the wearing friction caused by our totally dissimilar
temperaments began to make us feel that close companionship
was impossible, and we mutually agreed that he
should have rooms in London, visiting Eltham to see
myself and the children at week-ends.  After a while the
regularity of his week-end visits became very much broken,
but he still arrived fairly regularly to take the children
to Mass at Chislehurst on Sunday mornings, and he would
often get me up to town to do hostess when he wished to
give a dinner-party.  I had all my life been well known
at Thomas's Hotel, Berkeley Square, as my parents and
family had always stayed there when in London.  So here
I used to help Willie with his parties, and to suffer the
boredom incidental to this form of entertainment.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion Willie, who always said that even
if only for the sake of our children I ought not to "drop
out of everything," worried me into accepting invitations
to a ball given by the Countess &mdash;&mdash;, whom I did not
know, and for this I came up to town late in the afternoon,
dined quietly at the hotel by myself, and dressed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
for the ball, ready for Willie to fetch me as he had
promised after his dinner with some friends.  I was ready
at half-past eleven as had been arranged, and the carriage
came round for me at a quarter to twelve.  At twelve the
manageress, a friend from my childhood, came to see if
she could "do anything for me" as Captain O'Shea was
so late.  At 12.30 the head waiter, who used to lift me
into my chair at table on our first acquaintance, came to
know if "Miss Katie" was anxious about "the Captain,"
and got snubbed by the manageress for his pains.  At one
o'clock, white with anger and trembling with mortification,
I tore off my beautiful frock and got into bed.  At
nine o'clock the next morning Willie called, having only
just remembered my existence and the ball to which he
was to have taken me.
</p>

<p>
Willie was now longing for some definite occupation,
and he knew many political people.  While he was on
a visit to Ireland early in 1880 he was constantly urged
by his friends, the O'Donnells and others, to try for a seat
in the next Parliament.  A dissolution seemed imminent.
He had often talked of becoming a member for some Irish
constituency, and now, on again meeting The O'Gorman
Mahon in Ireland, he was very easily persuaded to stand
in with him for County Clare.  He wrote home to me to
know what I thought of the idea, saying that he feared
that, much as he should like it, the expenses would be
almost too heavy for us to manage.  I wrote back strongly
encouraging him to stand, for I knew it would give him
occupation he liked and keep us apart&mdash;and therefore good
friends.  Up to this time Willie had not met Mr. Parnell.

<br />
MR. PARNELL AND THE IRISH PARTY

<p class="poem">
  "<i>I loved those hapless ones&mdash;the Irish Poor&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All my life long.<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The introduction of the Arms Bill has interfered with
Mr. Parnell's further stay in France, and it is probable
he will be in his place in the House of Commons by the
time this is printed."
</p>

<p>
This paragraph appeared in the Nation early in 1880.
On the 8th March of that year, the Disraeli Parliament
dissolved, and on the 29th April Mr. Gladstone formed
his Ministry.
</p>

<p>
In the Disraeli Parliament Mr. Parnell was the actual,
though Mr. Shaw had been the nominal, leader of the
Irish Parliamentary Party since the death of Mr. Isaac
Butt in 1879.  Shaw continued the Butt tradition of
moderation and conciliation which had made the Irish
Party an unconsidered fraction in British politics.  Parnell
represented the new attitude of uncompromising hostility
to all British parties and of unceasing opposition to all
their measures until the grievances of Ireland were
redressed.  He carried the majority of his Party with him,
and in Ireland he was already the people's hero.
</p>

<p>
Born in June, 1846, Parnell was still a young man.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
He came of a fine race; he was a member of the same
family as the famous poet, Thomas Parnell, as Lord
Congleton, Radical reformer and statesman, and, above
all, Sir John Parnell, who sat and worked with Grattan
in Ireland's Great Parliament and shared with him the
bitter fight against the Union.  On his mother's side he
was the grandson of the famous Commodore Charles
Stewart, of the American Navy, whose bravery and success
in the War of Independence are well known.  It was
natural that a man of such ancestry should become a
champion of the rights of his native land.
</p>

<p>
Yet though in 1879 he was the virtual chief of the
Irish Party, eight years before he was an Irish country
gentleman, living quietly on his estates at Avondale in
County Wicklow.
</p>

<p>
It is a mistake to say that his mother "planted his
hatred of England in him," as she so seldom saw him
as a boy.  He was sent to school in England at six years
old, and he used to tell me how his father&mdash;who died when
he (Charles S. Parnell) was twelve years old&mdash;would send
for him to come to Ireland to see him.  His mother,
Mrs. Delia Parnell, lived chiefly in America, going over to
Avondale that her children might be born in Ireland, and
returning as soon as possible to America.  After her
husband's death she only visited the place occasionally, and
altogether saw very little of her son Charles.  He often
told me how well he remembered being sent for in his
father's last illness to go to him at Dublin, and the
last journey with his dying father back to Avondale.
His father had made him his heir and a ward of
Court.
</p>

<p>
In reality Parnell's hatred of England arose when he
began to study the records of England's misgovernment
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
in Ireland, and of the barbarities that were inflicted upon
her peasantry in the name of England's authority.
</p>

<p>
For years before he left the seclusion of Avondale this
hatred had been growing.  He followed the Fenian movement
with the liveliest interest, and he often accompanied
his sister Fanny when she took her verses to the offices
of the <i>Irish World</i>.  The sufferings of the Fenian
prisoners, so courageously borne, stirred his blood and
awakened his imagination.  It can be imagined with what
inward anger the young man heard of the detective raid
on his mother's house in Temple Street, Dublin&mdash;when
they found and impounded the sword he was privileged to
wear as an officer of the Wicklow Militia.
</p>

<p>
But it was the Manchester affair of 1867 and the execution
of Allen, Larkin and O'Brien which crystallized his
hatred of England.  From that moment he was only
biding his time.  Yet he was slow to move, and loath to
speak his mind, and, until he went to America in 1871,
he was better known for his cricketing and his autumn
shooting than for his politics.  When he returned to
Avondale with his brother John in 1872 the Ballot Act
had just been passed, and it was the consciousness of the
possibilities of the secret vote as a weapon against England
that finally persuaded him to be a politician.
</p>

<p>
But, though he joined the newly formed Home Rule
League, it was not until 1874 that he stood for Parliament
in Dublin County.  He came out at the bottom of the
poll.  The election cost him £2,000; the £300 which he
had received from the Home Rule League he handed back
to them.  In April, 1875, he stood for Meath and was
placed at the top of the poll.
</p>

<p>
When he entered Parliament the Irish Party, as I have
said, was of little account.  The case for Ireland was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
argued by Isaac Butt with fine reasonableness and forensic
skill, but it produced absolutely no effect.  The English
parties smiled and patted the Irish indulgently on the
head.  In Ireland all the more resolute and enthusiastic
spirits had an utter contempt for their Parliamentary
representatives; from the machine nothing was to be hoped.
It was the mission of Parnell to change all that, to unite
all the warring elements of the Nationalist movements
into one force to be hurled against England.
</p>

<p>
But still he waited and watched&mdash;learning the rules of
the House, studying the strength and weaknesses of the
machine he was to use and to attack.  He found it more
instructive to watch Biggar than Butt, for Biggar was
employing those methods of obstruction which Parnell
afterwards used with such perfect skill.  From June, 1876,
he took a hand in affairs.  Side by side with Biggar, he
began his relentless obstruction of Parliamentary business
until the demands of Ireland should be considered.
Already in 1877 he was fighting Butt for the direction of
the Irish Party.  On September 1st of that year Parnell
became President of the Home Rule Confederation of
Great Britain in place of Butt, and the victory was really
won.  Thenceforward Parnell was the true leader of the
Irish movement inside Parliament and out of it.  He
attracted the support of Fenians by his uncompromising
tactics and his fearless utterances, and when the New
Departure was proclaimed by Michael Davitt (just out of
prison) and John Devoy, and the Land League was formed
in 1879, Parnell was elected president.
</p>

<p>
The objects of the League were "best to be attained
by defending those who may be threatened with eviction
for refusing to pay unjust rents; and by obtaining such
reforms in the laws relating to land as will enable every
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
tenant to become the owner of his holding by paying a
fair rent for a limited number of years."  The League was
meant by its founders, Davitt and Devoy, to work for the
abolition of landlordism in Ireland, which, in turn, should
pave the way for separation.  Though Parnell was
himself working for Home Rule, the League became a
tremendous driving power behind his constitutional demands.
For some months Disraeli's Government did nothing,
while the agitation spread like wildfire.  Then in November
three of the leaders were arrested, on December 5th a
fourth&mdash;and in a few days released!  Ireland laughed, and
the League grew.  On December 21st Parnell and Dillon
sailed for New York to appeal for funds to save the tenant
farmers and to tighten the bond between the new
movement and the revolutionary societies of America.  His
triumphal progress through the States and Canada, his
reception by the Governors of States, members of Congress,
judges and other representative men, and finally his
appearance before Congress to develop his views on the
Irish situation, are well known.  It was on this journey&mdash;at
Toronto&mdash;that he was first hailed as the "Uncrowned
King."
</p>

<p>
The unexpected news of the dissolution summoned him
home.  In going out Disraeli tried to make Home Rule
the issue of the election, but Lord Hartington&mdash;who was
then leading the Liberal Party&mdash;and Mr. Gladstone
refused to take up the challenge.  All the English parties
were united in hostility to Home Rule.
</p>

<p>
But the violent manifesto of Disraeli threw the Irish
voting strength in England into the Liberal scale.  The
Liberals swept the country.
</p>

<p>
Curiously enough, even in Ireland the issue of the
election was not Home Rule.  There it was the land, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
nothing but the land.  For the harvest of 1879 had been
the worst since the great famine; evictions were in full
swing, and the Land League had begun its work.
</p>

<p>
The demand was for a measure securing the "three
F's": Fixity of tenure, fair rents determined by a legal
tribunal, and free sale of the tenant's interest.  But in
many constituencies the demand was for the extinction of
landlordism.
</p>

<p>
Parnell carried the election on his back.  He was fighting
not only the Liberals and the Tories, but the moderate
Home Rule followers of Mr. Shaw.  His energy seemed
inexhaustible; from one end of Ireland to the other he
organized the campaign, and addressed meetings.  The
result was a triumph for his policy and for the Land
League.  Of the 61 Home Rulers elected, 39 were
Parnellites.

CHAPTER VIII
<br />
THE FIRST MEETING WITH MR. PARNELL
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>One evening he asked the miller where the river went.</i>"<br />
  "<i>'It goes down the valley,' answered he, 'and turns a power<br />
  of mills.'</i>"&mdash;R. L. STEVENSON.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Willie and The O'Gorman Mahon had been returned at
the General Election, and many and varied were the
stories The O'Gorman Mahon told me subsequently of
their amusing experiences.  How they kissed nearly every
girl in Clare and drank with every man&mdash;and poor Willie
loathed Irish whisky&mdash;how Willie's innate fastidiousness
in dress brought gloom into the eyes of the peasantry
until his unfeigned admiration of their babies and live
stock, scrambing together about the cabins, "lifted a smile
to the lip."
</p>

<p>
The O'Gorman Mahon was then a tall, handsome old
man with a perfect snowstorm of white hair, and eyes as
merry and blue as those of a boy.  He could look as fierce
as an old eagle on occasion, however, and had fought,
in his day, more duels than he could remember.  A fine
specimen of the old type of Irishman.
</p>

<p>
When he came down to Eltham to see us, Willie and
I took him over to Greenwich and gave him a fish dinner.
We sat late into the night talking of Irish affairs, and The
O'Gorman Mahon said to me, "If you meet Parnell,
Mrs. O'Shea, be good to him.  His begging expedition to
America has about finished him, and I don't believe he'll
last the session out."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
</p>

<p>
He went on to speak of Mr. Parnell; how aloof and
reserved he was, and how he received any inquiries as
to his obviously bad health with a freezing hostility that
gave the inquirers a ruffled sense of tactlessness.
</p>

<p>
Willie broke in to say that he and I were going to
give some political dinners in London and would ask
Parnell, though he was sure he would not come.  The
O'Gorman Mahon paid some idle compliment, but I was
not interested particularly in their stories of Parnell,
though I mentally decided that if I gave any dinners to the
Irish Party for Willie I would make a point of getting
Parnell.
</p>

<p>
On the 26th of April the members of the Irish Party
met in Dublin to elect a chairman, and the meeting was
adjourned without coming to a decision, but in May
Mr. Parnell was chosen as leader.  Willie voted for him, with
twenty-two others, and telegraphed to me to say that he
had done so, but feared that Mr. Parnell might be too
"advanced."  The fact was that many people admired
steady-going William Shaw, the then chairman, as being
very "safe," and doubted whither their allegiance to
Mr. Parnell would lead them.  Years after, when their politics
had diverged, Mr. Parnell said: "I was right when I said
in '80, as Willie got up on that platform at Ennis, dressed
to kill, that he was just the man we did not want in the
Party."
</p>

<p>
After the meeting of Parliament Willie was insistent
that I should give some dinner parties in London, and,
as his rooms were too small for this purpose, we arranged
to have a couple of private rooms at Thomas's Hotel&mdash;my
old haunt in Berkeley Square.  There were no ladies'
clubs in those days, but this hotel served me for many years
as well as such a club could have done.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
</p>

<p>
We gave several dinners, and to each of them I asked
Mr. Parnell.  Among the first to come were Mr. Justin
McCarthy (the elder), Colonel Colthurst, Richard Power,
Colonel Nolan, and several others; but&mdash;in spite of his
acceptance of the invitation&mdash;Mr. Parnell did not come.
Someone alluded to the "vacant chair," and laughingly
defied me to fill it; the rest of our guests took up the
tale and vied with each other in tales of the inaccessibility
of Parnell, of how he ignored even the invitations of the
most important political hostesses in London, and of his
dislike of all social intercourse&mdash;though he had mixed
freely in society in America and Paris before he became
a politician for the sake of the Irish poor.  I then became
determined that I would get Parnell to come, and said,
amid laughter and applause: "The uncrowned King of
Ireland shall sit in that chair at the next dinner I
give!"
</p>

<p>
One bright sunny day when the House was sitting I
drove, accompanied by my sister, Mrs. Steele (who had
a house in Buckingham Gate), to the House of Commons
and sent in a card asking Mr. Parnell to come out and
speak to us in Palace Yard.
</p>

<p>
He came out, a tall, gaunt figure, thin and deadly pale.
He looked straight at me smiling, and his curiously
burning eyes looked into mine with a wondering intentness
that threw into my brain the sudden thought: "This man
is wonderful&mdash;and different."
</p>

<p>
I asked him why he had not answered my last invitation
to dinner, and if nothing would induce him to come.
He answered that he had not opened his letters for days,
but if I would let him, he would come to dinner directly
he returned from Paris, where he had to go for his sister's
wedding.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
</p>

<p>
In leaning forward in the cab to say good-bye a rose
I was wearing in my bodice fell out on to my skirt.  He
picked it up and, touching it lightly with his lips, placed
it in his button-hole.
</p>

<p>
This rose I found long years afterwards done up in an
envelope, with my name and the date, among his most
private papers, and when he died I laid it upon his
heart.
</p>

<p>
This is the first letter I had from Mr. Parnell:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
  LONDON,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>July</i> 17, 1880.<br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
MY DEAR MRS. O'SHEA,&mdash;We have all been in such a "disturbed"
condition lately that I have been quite unable to
wander further from here than a radius of about one hundred
<i>paces allons</i>.  And this notwithstanding the powerful attractions
which have been tending to seduce me from my duty towards
my country in the direction of Thomas's Hotel.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I am going over to Paris on Monday evening or Tuesday
morning to attend my sister's wedding, and on my return will
write you again and ask for an opportunity of seeing
you.&mdash;Yours very truly, CHAS. S. PARNELL.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On his return from Paris Mr. Parnell wrote to me,
and again we asked him to dinner, letting him name his
own date.  We thought he would like a quiet dinner, and
invited only my sister, Mrs. Steele, my nephew, Sir
Matthew Wood, Mr. Justin McCarthy, and a couple of
others whose names I forget.  On receiving his reply
accepting the invitation for the following Friday, we
engaged a box at the Gaiety Theatre&mdash;where Marion Hood
was acting (for whom I had a great admiration)&mdash;as we
thought it would be a relief to the "Leader" to get away
from politics for once.
</p>

<p>
On the day of the dinner I got this note:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
</p>

<p class="letter">
  HOUSE OF COMMONS,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
MY DEAR MRS. O'SHEA,&mdash;I dined with the Blakes on Wednesday,
and by the time dinner was over it was too late to go
to the meeting&mdash;the Post Office is all right here.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I cannot imagine who originated the paragraph.  I have
certainly made no arrangements up to the present to go either
to Ireland or America or announced any intention to
anybody.&mdash;Yours, CHAS. S. PARNELL.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He arrived late, but apologetic, and was looking painfully
ill and white, the only life-light in his face being
given by the fathomless eyes of rich brown, varying to
the brilliance of flame.  The depth of expression and
sudden fire of his eyes held me to the day of his death.
</p>

<p>
We had a pleasant dinner, talking of small nothings,
and, avoiding the controversial subject of politics,
Mr. Parnell directed most of his conversation to my sister
during dinner.  She could talk brilliantly, and her quick,
light handling of each subject as it came up kept him
interested and amused.  I was really anxious that he
should have an agreeable evening, and my relief was great
when he said that he was glad to go to the theatre with
us, as the change of thought it gave was a good rest for
him.
</p>

<p>
On arrival at the theatre he and I seemed to fall naturally
into our places in the dark corner of the box facing
the stage and screened from the sight of the audience,
while my sister and the others sat in front.
</p>

<p>
After we had settled in our seats Mr. Parnell began
to talk to me.  I had a feeling of complete sympathy and
companionship with him, as though I had always known
this strange, unusual man with the thin face and pinched
nostrils, who sat by my side staring with that curious
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
intent gaze at the stage, and telling me in a low monotone
of his American tour and of his broken health.
</p>

<p>
Then, turning more to me, he paused; and, as the
light from the stage caught his eyes, they seemed like
sudden flames.  I leaned a little towards him, still with
that odd feeling of his having always been there by my
side; and his eyes smiled into mine as he broke off his
theme and began to tell me of how he had met once more
in America a lady to whom he had been practically
engaged some few years before.
</p>

<p>
Her father would not dower her to go to Ireland, and
Parnell would not think of giving up the Irish cause and
settling in America.  The engagement therefore hung
fire; but on this last visit to America he had sought her
out and found himself cold and disillusioned.
</p>

<p>
She was a very pretty girl, he said, with golden hair,
small features and blue eyes.  One evening, on this last
visit, he went to a ball with her, and, as she was going
up the stairs, she pressed into his hand a paper on which
was written the following verse:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Unless you can muse in a crowd all day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the absent face that fixed you,<br />
  Unless you can dream that his faith is fast<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through behoving and unbehoving,<br />
  Unless you can die when the dream is past,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, never call it loving."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
He asked me who had written the lines, and I answered
that it sounded like one of the Brownings (it is
E. B. Browning's), and he said simply: "Well, I could not do
all that, so I went home."
</p>

<p>
I suggested that perhaps the lady had suffered in his
desertion, but he said that he had seen her, that same
evening, suddenly much attracted by a young advocate
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
named A&mdash;&mdash;, who had just entered the room, and
decided in his own mind that his vacillation had
lost him the young lady.  The strenuous work he had
then put his whole heart into had driven out all traces
of regret.
</p>

<p>
After this dinner-party I met him frequently in the
Ladies' Gallery of the House.  I did not tell him when I
was going; but, whenever I went, he came up for a few
minutes; and, if the Wednesday sittings were not very
important or required his presence, he would ask me to
drive with him.  We drove many miles this way in a
hansom cab out into the country, to the river at Mortlake,
or elsewhere.  We chiefly discussed Willie's chances of
being returned again for Clare, in case another election
was sprung upon us.  Both Willie and I were very anxious
to secure Mr. Parnell's promise about this, as The
O'Gorman Mahon was old, and we were desirous of
making Willie's seat in Parliament secure.
</p>

<p>
While he sat by my side in the meadows by the river
he promised he would do his best to keep Willie in
Parliament, and to secure County Clare for him should the
occasion arise.  Thus we would sit there through the
summer afternoon, watching the gay traffic on the river,
in talk, or in the silence of tried friendship, till the
growing shadows warned us that it was time to drive back to
London.
</p>

<p>
Soon after my first meeting with Mr. Parnell, my sister,
Mrs. Steele, invited Mr. Parnell, Mr. McCarthy and
myself to luncheon.  We had a very pleasant little party
at her house.  During lunch Mr. Parnell told us he was
going to his place in Ireland for some shooting, and
Mr. McCarthy and my sister chaffed him for leaving us for
the lesser game of partridge shooting, but he observed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
gravely, "I have the partridges there, and here I cannot
always have your society."
</p>

<p>
I had to leave early, as I was anxious to return to see
my aunt; and Mr. Parnell said he would accompany me
to the station.  When we got to Charing Cross the train
had already gone; and Mr. Parnell picked out a good
horse from the cab rank, saying it would be much
pleasanter to drive down on such a beautiful afternoon.
We did so, but I would not let him stay, as I was not
sure what state of confusion the house might be in, left
in my absence in the possession of the children and
governess.  I told him I had to hurry over the park to my
aunt, as really was the case, and he reluctantly returned
to London.
</p>

<p>
On the next Wednesday evening Mr. Parnell was to
dine with me at Thomas's Hotel.  He met me at Cannon
Street Station as the train came in, and asked me to have
some tea with him at the hotel there and go on to Thomas's
together.  We went to the Cannon Street Hotel dining-rooms,
but on looking in he saw some of the Irish members
there and said it would be more comfortable for us in his
private sitting-room.  I was under the impression that he
lived at Keppel Street, but he told me he had just taken
rooms in the Cannon Street Hotel.  We had tea in his
sitting-room, and he talked politics to me freely till I was
interested and at ease, and then lapsed into one of those
long silences of his that I was already beginning to know
were dangerous in the complete sympathy they evoked
between us.
</p>

<p>
Presently I said, "Come! we shall be late!"; and he
rose without a word and followed me downstairs.  There
were some members of his Party still standing about in
the hall, but, as he always did afterwards when I was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
with him, he ignored them absolutely and handed me into
a waiting cab.
</p>

<p>
He and I dined at Thomas's Hotel that evening, and
after dinner I returned home to Eltham.  Mr. Parnell left
for Ireland by the morning mail.
</p>

<p>
From Dublin he wrote to me:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">
  <i>September</i> 9, 1880.<br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
MY DEAR MRS. O'SHEA,&mdash;Just a line to say that I have
arrived here, and go on to Avondale, Rathdrum, this evening,
where I hope to hear from you before very long.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I may tell you also in confidence that I don't feel quite so
content at the prospect of ten days' absence from London
amongst the hills and valleys of Wicklow as I should have
done some three months since.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The cause is mysterious, but perhaps you will help me to
find it, or her, on my return.&mdash;Yours always,
CHAS. S. PARNELL.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Then from his home:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">
  AVONDALE, RATHDRUM,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>September</i> 11, 1880.<br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
MY DEAR MRS. O'SHEA,&mdash;I take the opportunity which a
few hours in Dublin gives me of letting you know that I am
still in the land of the living, notwithstanding the real difficulty
of either living or being, which every moment becomes more
evident, in the absence of a certain kind and fair face.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Probably you will not hear from me again for a few days, as
I am going into the mountains for some shooting, removed
from post offices and such like consolations for broken-hearted
politicians, but if, as I hope, a letter from you should reach me
even there, I shall try and send you an answer.&mdash;Yours very
sincerely, CHAS. S. PARNELL.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br />
AT ELTHAM
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>But then&mdash;I supposed you to be but a fellow guest?</i>"<br />
  "<i>Ah, no" he answered, he in that cold, unshaken voice, "I<br />
  have but come home.</i>"&mdash;(THE BAGMAN) HONORA SHEE.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Whenever I went to town, or elsewhere, I always
returned at night to see that my children were all right and
to be ready to go to my aunt as usual every morning.
One day, on my return from a drive with my aunt, I
found that my old nurse Lucy, who still lived with me,
was very ill, having had a stroke of paralysis while I was
away.  She lingered only a couple of days before she died
and left a great void in my heart.  My children missed
their admiring old confidante sadly.  She had always been
devoted to me as the youngest of her "own babies," as
she called my mother's children, and had shared in all
my fortunes and misfortunes since I returned from Spain.
She was always very proud, and so fearful of becoming
a burden to anyone, that she rented a room in her sister's
house so that she should feel independent.  So often,
when "times were bad" with us, she would press some
of her savings into my hand and say that "The Captain
must want a little change, Dearie, going about as he
does!"
</p>

<p>
In her earlier life she had had her romance, and had
spent some years in saving up to marry her "sweetheart,"
as she called him; but shortly before the wedding her
father's business failed, and she immediately gave him
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
all her little nest-egg, with the result that her lover
refused to marry her.  So then, at the great age of ninety,
after her blameless life had been passed since the age of
sixteen in unselfish devotion to us all, we laid her to rest
by the side of my father and mother at Cressing, Willie
taking her down to Essex and attending the funeral.
</p>

<p>
As she lay dying I got this note from Mr. Parnell:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">
  DUBLIN,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>September</i> 22, 1880.<br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
MY DEAR MRS. O'SHEA,&mdash;I cannot keep myself away from
you any longer, so shall leave to-night for London.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Please wire me to 16, Keppel Street, Russell Square, if I
may hope to see you to-morrow and where, after 4 p.m.&mdash;Yours
always, C. S. P.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Owing to the piteous clinging to my fingers of my
old Lucy I was unable to go to London even for an hour
to meet Mr. Parnell, so I telegraphed to that effect, and
received the following letter:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">
  EUSTON STATION,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Friday evening, September</i> 24, 1880.<br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
MY DEAR MRS. O'SHEA,&mdash;On arriving at Keppel Street
yesterday I found that your wire had just arrived, and that
the boy refused to leave it as I was not stopping there.  Going
at once to the district postal office I asked for and received
the wire, and to-day went to London Bridge Station at 12.15.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The train from Eltham had just left, so I came on to Charing
Cross and sent a note by messenger to you at Thomas's, with
directions to bring it back if you were not there, which turned
out to be the case.  I am very much troubled at not having
seen you, especially as I must return to Ireland to-night&mdash;I
came on purpose for you, and had no other business.  I think it
possible, on reflection, that the telegraph people may have wired
you that they were unable to deliver your message, and, if so,
must reproach myself for not having written you last
night.&mdash;Your very disappointed C. S. P.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
</p>

<p>
From Dublin he wrote me:
</p>

<p class="letter">
  <i>Saturday morning, September</i> 25, 1880.<br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
MY DEAR MRS. O'SHEA,&mdash;In my hurried note to you last
night I had not time to sympathize with you in this troublesome
time you have been going through recently; how I wish it
might have been possible for me to have seen you even for a
few minutes to tell you how very much I feel any trouble which
comes to you.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I am just starting for New Ross, where there is a meeting
to-morrow.
</p>

<p class="letter">
If you can spare time to write me to Avondale, the letters
will reach me in due course.&mdash;Yours always, C. S. P.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
  <i>September</i> 29, 1880.<br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
MY DEAR MRS. O'SHEA,&mdash;I have received your wire, but not
the letter which you say you were writing me to Dublin for
Monday.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I suppose then you may have sent it to Rathdrum instead,
whither I am going this evening, and that I may soon have the
happiness of reading a few words written by you.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I am due at Cork on Sunday, after which I propose to visit
London again, and renew my attempt to gain a glimpse of
you.  Shall probably arrive there on Tuesday if I hear from
you in the meanwhile that you will see me.
</p>

<p class="letter">
On Friday evening I shall be at Morrison's on my way
to Kilkenny for Saturday, and shall be intensely delighted to
have a wire from you to meet me there.&mdash;Yours always,
CHAS. S. PARNELL.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Meanwhile Willie was in communication with Mr. Gladstone,
Mr. Tintern (one of the Liberal agents) and
others, in reference to a meeting held by him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tintern wrote from Tenby commenting with satisfaction
on the report of Willie's successful meeting, on
Willie's kind mention of the Government, and on the
good the meeting must do by promoting orderly progress
and better feeling between one class and another.  But he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
expressed surprise that Willie should think the
Government had not treated him and West Clare well.  He at
least...!  Mr. Gladstone wrote from Downing Street
on the 21st September about the meeting in much the same
terms.  He expressed himself as gratified to think that the
important local proceedings with regard to the land
question showed the union of people and pastors against the
extremists.
</p>

<p>
Life at Eltham went on in the same routine.  My aunt
was well, and would sit for long hours at the south door
of her house&mdash;looking away up "King John's Chase"&mdash;the
ruins of King John's Palace were at Eltham, and my
aunt's park and grounds were part of the ancient Royal
demesne.  In these summer evenings she loved to sit at
the top of the broad flight of shallow steps with me, and
tell my little girls stories of her life of long ago.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes her favourite Dr. Bader would bring his
zither down from London and play to us; or my aunt and
I would sit in the great tapestry room with all of the
seven windows open, listening to the song of the æolian
harp as the soft breeze touched its strings and died away
in harmony through the evening stillness.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, too, she would sing in her soft, gentle
old voice the songs of her youth, to the accompaniment
of her guitar.  "We met, 'twas in a crowd," was a
favourite old song of hers, half forgotten since she used to
sing it to the music of her spinet seventy years before,
but Dr. Bader found the words in an old book, and the
dear old lady crooned it sentimentally to me as we sat
waiting for the hooting of the owls which signalled to
her maid the time for shutting her lady's windows.
</p>

<p>
And I was conscious of sudden gusts of unrest and
revolt against these leisured, peaceful days where the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
chiming of the great clock in the hall was the only
indication of the flight of time, and the outside world of
another age called to me with the manifold interests into
which I had been so suddenly plunged with the power to
help in the making and marring of a destiny.
</p>

<p>
In the autumn of 1880 Mr. Parnell came to stay with
us at Eltham, only going to Dublin as occasion required.
Willie had invited him to come, and I got in some flowers
in pots and palms to make my drawing-room look pretty
for him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Parnell, who was in very bad health at that time,
a few days later complained of sore throat, and looked,
as I thought, mournfully at my indoor garden, which I
industriously watered every day.  It then dawned upon
me that he was accusing this of giving him sore throat,
and I taxed him with it.  He evidently feared to vex me,
but admitted that he did think it was so, and "wouldn't
it do if they were not watered so often?"  He was
childishly touched when I at once had them all removed,
and he sank happily on to the sofa, saying that "plants
were such damp things!"
</p>

<p>
His throat became no better, and he looked so terribly
ill when&mdash;as he often did now&mdash;he fell asleep from sheer
weakness on the sofa before the fire, that I became very
uneasy about him.  Once, on awaking from one of these
sleeps of exhaustion, he told me abruptly that he believed
it was the green in the carpet that gave him sore throat.
There and then we cut a bit out, and sent it to London
to be analysed, but without result.  It was quite a harmless
carpet.
</p>

<p>
During this time I nursed him assiduously, making
him take nourishment at regular intervals, seeing that
these day-sleeps of his were not disturbed, and forcing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
him to take fresh air in long drives through the country
around us.  At length I had the satisfaction of seeing
his strength gradually return sufficiently to enable him to
take the exercise that finished the process of this
building-up, and he became stronger than he had been for some
years.  I do not think anyone but we who saw him then
at Eltham, without the mask of reserve he always
presented to the outside world, had any idea of how near
death's door his exertions on behalf of the famine-stricken
peasants of Ireland had brought him.
</p>

<p>
Once in that autumn, after he came to us, I took him
for a long drive in an open carriage through the
hop-growing district of Kent.  I had not thought of the fact
that hundreds of the poorest of the Irish came over for the
hop-picking, and might recognize him.
</p>

<p>
After driving over Chislehurst Common and round by
the lovely Grays, we came right into a crowd of the Irish
"hoppers"&mdash;men, women, and children.  In a moment
there was a wild surge towards the carriage, with cries of
"The Chief!  The Chief!" and "Parnell!  Parnell!
Parnell!"  The coachman jerked the horses on to their
haunches for fear of knocking down the enthusiastic men
and women who were crowding up&mdash;trying to kiss Parnell's
hand, and calling for "a few words."
</p>

<p>
He lifted his cap with that grave, aloof smile of his,
and said no, he was not well enough to make the smallest
of speeches, but he was glad to see them, and would talk
to them when they went home to Ireland.  Then, bidding
them to "mind the little ones," who were scrambling about
the horses' legs, to the manifest anxiety of the coachman,
he waved them away, and we drove off amid fervent "God
keep your honours!" and cheers.
</p>

<p>
These Irish hop-pickers were so inured to privation
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
in their own country that they were very popular among
the Kentish hop-farmers, as they did not grumble so much
as did the English pickers at the scandalously inefficient
accommodation provided for them.
</p>

<p>
Often before Parnell became really strong I used to
watch for hours beside him as he slept before the drawing-room
fire, till I had to rouse him in time to go to the House.
Once, when he was moving restlessly, I heard him murmur
in his sleep, as I pulled the light rug better over him:
"Steer carefully out of the harbour&mdash;there are breakers
ahead."
</p>

<p>
He now had all the parcels and letters he received sent
on to me, so that I might open them and give him only
those it was necessary for him to deal with.  There were
hundreds of letters to go through every week, though, as
he calmly explained, "If you get tired with them, leave
them and they'll answer themselves."
</p>

<p>
Often among the parcels there were comestibles, and
among these every week came a box of eggs without the
name and address of the sender.  I was glad to see these
eggs as the winter came on and with it the usual reluctance
of our hens to provide us with sufficient eggs, but
Mr. Parnell would not allow me to use them, for he said:
"They might be eggs, but then again they might not,"
and I had to send them a good distance down the garden
and have them broken to make sure of their genuineness,
and then he would worry lest our dogs should find them
and poison themselves.
</p>

<p>
On his visits to Ireland he wrote to me continually:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">

<p class="letter">

a few minutes to spare.

<p>
Meanwhile the Government had been temporizing with
the land question.  They had brought in a very feeble
Compensation for Disturbances Bill and they had allowed
it to be further weakened by amendments.  This Bill was
rejected by the House of Lords, with the result that the
number of evictions in Ireland grew hourly greater and
the agitation of the Land League against them; outrages,
too, were of common occurrence and increased in intensity.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
</p>

<p>
Speaking at Ennis on September 19th Mr. Parnell
enunciated the principle which has since gone by the
name of "The Boycott."
</p>

<p>
"What are you to do," he asked, "to a tenant who
bids for a farm from which another tenant has been
evicted?"
</p>

<p>
Several voices cried: "Shoot him!"
</p>

<p>
"I think," went on Mr. Parnell, "I heard somebody
say 'Shoot him!'  I wish to point out to you a very much
better way&mdash;a more Christian and charitable way, which
will give the lost man an opportunity of repenting.  When
a man takes a farm from which another has been unjustly
evicted, you must shun him on the roadside when you
meet him; you must shun him in the shop; you must shun
him on the fair-green and in the market-place, and even
in the place of worship, by leaving him alone; by putting
him into a sort of moral Coventry; by isolating him from
the rest of the country, as if he were a leper of old&mdash;you
must show him your detestation of the crime he has
committed."
</p>

<p>
Forster, the Irish Secretary, who had some amount of
sympathy for the tenants, was, however, a Quaker, and
the outrages horrified him more than the evictions.  Nor,
strangely, was he able to connect the one with the other.
Undoubtedly the evictions almost ceased, but, said he,
they have ceased because of the outrages, and the
outrages were the work of the Land League; and he pressed
for the arrest of its leaders.  This was unwise, considering
that it was Parnell who had advocated the abandonment
of violence for the moral suasion of the boycott.
</p>

<p>
On November 3rd Forster decided to prosecute the
leaders of the Land League, and among them Parnell,
Dillon, Biggar, Sexton and T. D. Sullivan.  Two days
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
later, in a speech at Dublin, Parnell expressed his regret
that Forster was degenerating from a statesman to a tool
of the landlords.  Biggar when he heard the news
exclaimed, "Damned lawyers, sir, damned lawyers!
Wasting the public money!  Wasting the public money!
Whigs damned rogues!  Forster damned fool!"

you before I leave.  Do you think you shall be in town on

<p>
On November 5th that year the village was great on
the subject of "gunpowder, treason, and plot," and during
dinner that evening there was such a noise and shouting
outside my house that I asked the maid who was waiting
what all the excitement was about.
</p>

<p>
She answered breathlessly that "the procession, ma'am,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
have got Miss Anna Parnell in a effigy 'longside of the
Pope, and was waiting outside for us to see before they
burnt 'em in the village."
</p>

<p>
This electrifying intelligence was received with grave
indifference by Mr. Parnell till the disappointed maid left
the room; then with a sudden bubble of laughter&mdash;"Poor
Anna!  Her pride in being burnt, as a menace to England,
would be so drowned in horror at her company that
it would put the fire out!"
</p>

<p>
The cheering and hooting went on for some time outside
the house, but, finding we were not to be drawn,
the crowd at last escorted the effigies down to the village
and burnt them, though with less amusement than they
had anticipated.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br />
THE LAND LEAGUE TRIALS
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"<i>The surest way to prevent seditions is to take away the matter
of them.</i>"&mdash;LORD BACON.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Through the whole of 1880 Parnell was determinedly
organizing the Land League throughout Ireland, and
during the winter, doubtless encouraged by the enormous
distress that prevailed over the whole country, the force
and power of the League grew with a rapidity that surpassed
even the expectations of Parnell and his party.  All
through the vacation Parnell and his followers held meetings
in carefully calculated areas of Ireland, and in his
speeches Parnell explained the meaning and wide-reaching
scope of the League's agitation, i.e. that tenant farmers
were to trust in their own combination alone and "should
give no faith to the promises of the English Ministers."
</p>

<p>
During the early session that year Parnell had introduced
a Bill called "Suspension of Ejectments Bill," and
this first pressed upon the House the necessity of
dealing with the Irish landlord troubles.  Parnell's party
urged this Bill with so united a front that Mr. Gladstone
was obliged to consider the main substance of it, and he
agreed to insert a clause in the "Relief of Distress Bill"
which would deal with impending evictions of Irish
tenants.  But the Speaker of the House held that the
interpolation of such a clause would not be "in order," and
the Chief Secretary for Ireland (Mr. Forster) then, by
Mr. Gladstone's direction, brought in his "Disturbances Bill,"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
which was to all practical purposes Parnell's Bill under
another name.
</p>

<p>
In the course of the debate on this Bill Mr. Gladstone
himself said that "in the circumstances of distress prevalent
in Ireland (at that time) a sentence of eviction is the
equivalent of a sentence of death."  These absolutely true words
of Gladstone's were used by Parnell very many times
during his Land League tours both in speeches and privately,
and many times he added&mdash;as so often he did to me at
home&mdash;bitter comment upon the apathy of the English
Government, upon the curious insensibility of the English
law-makers, who knew these things to be true in Ireland
and yet were content to go on in their policy of drift,
unless forced into action by those who saw the appalling
reality of the distress among the Irish poor that was so
comfortably deplored in London.
</p>

<p>
In this connexion Parnell used to say that the fundamental
failure in the English government of Ireland was:
First, the complete inability of the Ministers in power to
realize anything that was not before their eyes; and,
secondly, their cast-iron conviction that Ireland was the one
country of the world that was to be understood and
governed by those to whom she was little but a name.
</p>

<p>
In all this time of trouble and eviction Parnell went
backwards and forwards between England (Eltham) and
Ireland as occasion required, and so successful were his
efforts in spreading the agitation and linking up the
League that the Government became uneasy as to the
outcome of this new menace to landlordism.  Finally Parnell
and fourteen of his followers were put on trial, charged
with "conspiracy to impoverish landlords."  Parnell, of
course, went over to Ireland for these "State trials," but
he considered the whole thing such a farce, in that it was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
an impotent effort of the Government to intimidate him,
that he could not take it seriously in any way.  No jury
(in Ireland) would agree to convict him he was well aware,
and he attended the trials chiefly, he said, for the "look
of the thing," and to give the support of his presence to
his colleagues.  Incidentally he told me on one occasion
that he had considerably hurried the jury when he was
very anxious to catch a train in time for the night mail to
England (Eltham) by "willing" them to agree (to disagree)
without the long discussion of local politics with
which all self-respecting Irish jurors beguile the weary
ways of law.  He observed that here, in the question of
how far an unconscious agent can be "willed" into a
desired action, he had discovered another and most
entrancing study for us when we had more time to go into it
thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
Talking of the Land League's procedure against the
interests of the Irish landlords, I may, I think, here
pertinently remind those who have, among so many other
accusations, brought against Parnell the charge of
self-seeking in regard to money matters, that Parnell himself
was an Irish landlord and of very considerable estates,
and that this land campaign (really, of course, directed
against eviction), meant, to all practical purposes, the loss
of his rents, and that not only for a time, as in other cases,
but, with the very generous interpretation put upon his
wishes by the "Chief's" tenants, for all time&mdash;or rather
for all his lifetime.  Captain O'Shea also had certain
estates in Ireland, and naturally, not being in sympathy
with Parnell's policy, but being at heart a thorough Whig
and a strong advocate for Mr. Shaw, the ex-leader of the
Irish party, he was furious at the League's anti-landlord
work, and refused to have any hand in it.  He considered
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
that hapless as was the plight of those who had to pay in
rent the money they did not possess, that of the landlord
whose rent was his all was but little to be preferred.
</p>

<p>
During this period the stories of the evictions brought
home to me by Parnell himself made my heart sick, and
often he sat far into the night at Eltham speaking in that
low, broken monotone, that with him always betokened
intense feeling strongly held in check, of the terrible
cruelty of some of the things done in the name of justice
in unhappy Ireland.  How old people, and sometimes
those sick beyond recovery, women with the children they
had borne but a few hours before, little children naked as
they had come into the world, all thrust out from the little
squalid cabins which were all they had for home, thrust
out on the roadside to perish, or to live as they could.  I
in my English ignorance used to say: "Why did they
not go into the workhouse or to neighbours?" and Parnell
would look wonderingly at me as he told me that for the
most part such places were few and far between in Ireland,
and "neighbours," good as they were to each other, were
in the same trouble.  There were instances where a wife
would beg, and with none effect, that the bailiffs and police
should wait but the little half-hour that her dying husband
drew his last breath; and where a husband carried his
wife from her bed to the "shelter" of the rainswept moor
that their child might be born out of the sight of the
soldiers deputed to guard the officials who had been sent
to pull their home about their ears.  And, remembering
these and so many other tales of some of the 50,000
evictions that he afterwards calculated had taken place in
Ireland, I have never wondered at the implacable hatred
of England that can never really die out of the Irish
heart.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
</p>

<p>
On December 4th, 1880, he wrote to me from Dublin:
</p>

<p class="letter">
I was exceedingly pleased to receive your letters; to say
the truth, I have been quite homesick since leaving Eltham,
and news from you seems like news from home.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The Court refused our application to-day for a postponement
of the trial (of the Land League), but this we expected,
and it does not much signify, as it turns out that we need not
necessarily attend the trial unless absolutely directed to do so
by the Court.
</p>

<p class="letter">
You will also be pleased to hear that the special jury panel,
of which we obtained a copy last night, is of such a character
as in the opinion of competent judges to give us every chance
of a disagreement by the jury in their verdict, but we cannot,
of course, form an absolute conclusion until the jury has been
sworn, when we shall be able to tell pretty certainly one way
or the other.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Since writing Captain O'Shea it does not look as if I could
get further away from Ireland than London, as Paris is
inconvenient from its distance.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I have no letter from him yet in reply to mine.
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>
And again on the 9th:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">
I returned from Waterford last night, and shall probably
get through all necessary work here by Saturday evening so
as to enable me to start for London on Sunday morning.  I
do not know how long I can remain in London, but shall run
down and see you on Monday, and perhaps my plans will be
more fixed by that time.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I have decided not to attend any more meetings until after
the opening of Parliament, as everything now can go on
without me.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Kindly inform Captain O'Shea that the meeting of Irish
members will be in Dublin on the 4th January.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On December 12th of that year Mr. Parnell wrote from
Avondale to say that the jury panel was to be struck on
the following Monday for the prosecution of the Land
League.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
</p>

<p class="letter">
... And it will be necessary for me to see it before
giving final directions.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I have consequently postponed my departure till Monday
evening.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I have come here to arrange my papers and find a number
which I should not like to destroy, and which I should not
like the Government to get hold of in the event of their
searching my house in the troublous times which appear before us.
May I leave them at Eltham?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And the next day:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">
I have just received a note from Healy, who is to be tried
at Cork on Thursday, saying that his counsel thinks it of the
utmost importance I should be present.
</p>

<p class="letter">
This is very hard lines on me, as I had looked forward to
a little rest in London before my own trial commences; but
I do not see how it can be helped, as Healy's is the first of
the State trials, and it is of the utmost importance to secure an
acquittal and not merely a disagreement.  I shall leave Cork
on Thursday night and arrive in London Friday evening,
and shall call to see you at Eltham Saturday.  Your letters,
one directed here and the others to Morrison's, reached me
in due course, and I hope to hear from you again very soon.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Parnell, now, always made my house his headquarters
in England, and on his return from Ireland after the trials
came down at once as soon as he had ascertained that I
was alone.
</p>

<p>
There were times when he wished to keep quiet and
let no one know where he was; and, as it became known
to the Government that Mr. Parnell frequented my house
a good deal, it was somewhat difficult to avoid the
detectives who were employed to watch his comings and goings.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion in 1880 he was informed privately
that his arrest for "sedition" was being urged upon the
Government, and that it would be well to go abroad for
a short time.  I think his enigmatic reply, "I will
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
disappear for a few weeks," must have puzzled his informant.
He came down to me at night, and when I answered his
signal at my sitting-room window, and let him in, he told
me with a deprecating smile that I must hide him for a
few weeks.  As I sat watching him eat the supper I always
had ready for him at 3 a.m. I felt rather hopeless, as he
was a big man, and I did not see how he could be hidden
from the servants.  He said the latter must not know he
was there, as they would talk to the tradespeople, and
they to the Government men.  He did not wish to be
arrested until later on, when it might be more useful than
not.
</p>

<p>
Then he awaited suggestions, and at length we decided
that a little room opening out of my own must be utilized
for him, as I always kept it locked and never allowed a
servant into it&mdash;except very occasionally to "turn it
out."  It was a little boudoir dressing-room, and had a sofa
in it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Parnell was then still feeling ill and run down,
and enjoyed his fortnight's absolute rest in this room.
None of the servants knew that he was there, and I took
all his food up at night, cooking little dainty dishes for
him at the open fire, much to his pleasure and amusement.
He spent the time very happily, resting, writing
"seditious" speeches for future use, and reading "Alice in
Wonderland."  This book was a favourite of his, and I
gave it to him with the solemnity that befitted his grave
reading of it.  I do not think he ever thought it in the
least amusing, but he would read it earnestly from cover
to cover, and, without a smile, remark that it was a
"curious book."
</p>

<p>
In all this fortnight no one had the least idea that he
was in the house, and the only comment I ever heard upon
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
my prisoner's diet was that "the mistress ate much more
when she had her meals served in her sitting-room."
</p>

<p>
At the end of this fortnight he had arranged to go to
Paris on some Land League business, and wanted me to
go to see him off.  He had brought certain political
correspondence from Avondale and London and placed it in
my charge, and this I kept in a box in this little private
room, where I hid them.  But there were two papers that
he did not wish left even here, and, fearing arrest, could
not carry on him.  For these he had a wide, hollow gold
bracelet made in Paris, and after inserting the papers he
screwed the bracelet safely on my arm; there it remained
for three years, and was then unscrewed by him and the
contents destroyed.
</p>

<p>
The winter of 1880 was terribly cold, and as I let him
out of the house in the bitterly cold morning I wished
he did not consider it necessary to go to Paris by such
a roundabout route as he had chosen.
</p>

<p>
However, we drove off to Lewisham that morning,
quite unobserved; from thence we went by train to New
Cross, and drove by cab to London Bridge.  At Vauxhall
we started for Lowestoft; for Mr. Parnell had arranged to
go to Paris via Harwich.  I was anxious about him, for
the cold was intense, and the deep snow over the large
dreary waste of salt marshes seemed reflected in his pallor.
Our train slowly passed through the dreary tract of
country, feet deep in its white covering, and we could see no
sign of life but an occasional seagull vainly seeking for
food, and sending a weird call through the lonely
silences.
</p>

<p>
I wrapped Parnell up in his rugs as he tried to sleep.
I loathed the great white expanse that made him look so
ill, and I wished I had him at home again, where I could
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
better fight the great fear that so often beset my heart:
that I could not long keep off the death that hovered near
him.  A lady and gentleman in the carriage remarked to
me&mdash;thinking he slept&mdash;that my husband looked terribly
ill, could they do anything?  And I noticed the little smile
of content that flitted over his face as he heard me briskly
reply that, No, he had been ill, but was so much better
and stronger that I was not at all uneasy.  It was the cold
glare of the snow that made him look so delicate, but he
was really quite strong.  He hated to be thought ill, and
did not see the doubt in their faces at my reply.
</p>

<p>
Arrived at Lowestoft I insisted upon his resting and
having a good meal, after which he felt so cheered up that
he decided to return to London with me, and go to Paris
by the usual route the next day!
</p>

<p>
We had a new Irish cook at this time, from County
Tipperary, and her joy exceeded all bounds when she
learnt that the Irish leader was really in the house and she
was to cook for him.  I had to ask Mr. Parnell to see
her for a moment, as she was too excited to settle to her
cooking.  Directly she got into the room Ellen fell down
on her knees and kissed his hands, much to his horror,
for, although used to such homage in Ireland, he disliked
it extremely, and he told me with some reproach that he
had expected to be quite free from that sort of thing in
my house.
</p>

<p>
At Christmas he tipped my servants generously, and
indeed Ellen and the parlourmaid Mary vied with each
other in their attention to his comfort.  The enthusiasm
of the cook was so great that she bought an enormous gold
locket, and, having inserted a portrait of Mr. Parnell in
it, wore it constantly.  Mary, not to be outdone, thereupon
bought a locket of identically the same design, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
wore it with an air of defiance, when bringing in tea, on
New Year's Day.
</p>

<p>
This was against all regulations, and I said laughingly
to Mr. Parnell that he was introducing lawlessness into
my household.  He answered, "Leave it to me," and
when Mary appeared again he said gently to her, "Mary,
that is a magnificent locket, and I see you are kind enough
to wear my portrait in it.  Mrs. O'Shea tells me that Ellen
has bought one also, but I just want you and Ellen not to
wear them outside like that, for Mrs. O'Shea lets me come
down here for a rest, and if people know I'm here I shall
be worried to death with politics and people calling."  So
Mary promised faithfully, and Ellen came running in to
promise too, and to threaten vengeance on "the others"
if absolute silence was not observed.  The lockets went
"inside," and only a tiny bit of chain was allowed to show
at the throat in evidence of homage continued, though
hidden.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, events were fusing in Ireland.  Parnell had
gone over there immediately after Christmas.  From
Dublin he wrote:&mdash;

the Government will attempt to prevent me from being
present at the opening of Parliament, though I am not quite
sure yet whether it will be prudent for me to leave until
Wednesday evening.  So far as I can see there is no necessity
for the presence of any of the Traversers; one of them, Gordon,
who has broken his leg, has not appeared at all, and his absence
has not been even mentioned or noticed.

<p class="letter">
MY DEAREST WIFIE,&mdash;Was most delighted on return this
morning from Avondale to find your three letters and telegrams.
I think it would make you happy and more contented during
my absence if you knew how I watched for your letters, and
how often I read and re-read them.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I felt very much tempted to run over and spend the New
Year and Sunday with you, but feared you might not be alone.

It pains me very much that my own love was unhappy
about that stupid thing in the <i>Freeman</i> on Thursday.  An
old and ugly woman with whom I was very slightly acquainted,
but who wanted to put herself <i>en evidence</i>, perched herself
just behind me, and got a gentleman sitting next to her to
hand me down a slip of paper, on which was written some
message of congratulation.  I only rewarded her with a stare,
did not even bow or smile, and certainly sent no communication
of any kind in reply.  That was all.  I will ask my own
dearest to believe in me while I am away, and never again to
feel unhappiness from want of confidence.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I have made all arrangements to leave by mail on Wednesday
morning, and shall be with my own wifie on Wednesday
evening about eight.&mdash;Yours, C. S. P.

<p>
Mr. Parnell held the Party meeting in Dublin on
January 4th, and returned to me on January 5th, in time
for the meeting of the House (on 6th January, 1881), not
having thought it necessary to remain in Ireland till the
termination of the trials&mdash;a circumstance which, curiously
enough, was not publicly remarked upon.  We spent some
days together at Eltham, and I took Mr. Parnell to see my
aunt, who was much charmed with him.  His quiet manners
and soft, clear voice pleased her greatly, as also did
his personal appearance.  She took his arm, and paced up
and down the tapestry room with him, while she told him
how she was introduced to O'Connell in the old days, when
her husband, Benjamin Wood, was M.P. for Southwark.
She had met O'Connell at the House, and heard what was
said to have been one of his greatest speeches.  She said,
"I much prefer your voice, Mr. Parnell, for Daniel
O'Connell's enunciation was startling to me."
</p>

<p>
Though such a great age, my aunt had still a very
pretty round arm, and as she always wore the net sleeves
of her youth, fastened with old-fashioned bracelets,
Mr. Parnell noticed this, and commented upon the fact to me.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
The old lady was much gratified when I told her of this.
She enlisted his sympathy by telling him that she had to
pay £500 a year in order to keep her beautiful old grounds
intact, as the Crown desired to sell the place for building
lots, and she was determined to die in the old house she
had lived in for over fifty years.
</p>

<p>
The State trial ended on January 25th, 1881, the
foreman of the jury stating: "We are unanimous that we
cannot agree," as Mr. Parnell had assured me they would.
He was in Court and loudly cheered as he hastened off to
catch the boat to England.

CHAPTER XI
<br />
PARLIAMENTARY ASSOCIATIONS
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"<i>Live to-day&mdash;the past is registered&mdash;the future is
unguessed&mdash;the instant ours.</i>"&mdash;MORTIMER COLLINS.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Forster's Coercion Bill was introduced on January 24th,
1881, and on the 25th Mr. Gladstone moved that it should
have precedence of all other business before the House.
Mr. Parnell fiercely opposed this motion, and kept his
followers hard at work in opposition&mdash;thus forcing the House
to sit from 4 p.m. on Tuesday until 2 p.m. of the next
day.  The details of these sittings have been recounted
ad nauseam, and I need not repeat them here, but only
record Parnell's fierce joy in these political fights, and my
pride in him as I watched him from the Ladies' Gallery.
Sometimes Willie would wish to give the seats he secured
in the Ladies' Gallery to friends of his, and on such
occasions I always knew that Mr. Parnell would ballot one for
me.  Of course, later on I could always secure a seat without
ballot, if one was vacant, as I had to wait to receive
messages from Mr. Parnell and Mr. Gladstone, and it was
made known to the attendants that on any important
occasion I held priority of place.
</p>

<p>
As a rule, after an all-night sitting he used to drive
down to Eltham in order not to become well known on
the Eltham railway, and come through the conservatory
into my sitting-room, where I would have supper ready
for him before the fire, with his smoking-jacket and
slippers ready to put on.  He seldom spoke after his first
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
greeting.  He would take off his frock-coat and boots,
and, when I slipped on the others for him, he would eat
his supper quite silently, thinking over the events of the
night.  I never worried him to talk.  Supper finished, he
would light a cigar and sit down in his own arm-chair,
saying, "Well, Queenie, the Old Man spoke to-night," or
"So-and-so spoke," and then slowly tell me of all that
had passed during the sitting, and his opinion of the
present and future, so far as politics were concerned.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes when he had spoken himself he would say:
"I did not speak well to-night," and sometimes it was:
"I lost that quotation you gave me and brought it out
sideways, and there it was all the time crushed up in my
hand!  Then I forgot the fellow's name and called him
'the poet.'"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Shakespeare can be called 'the poet,'" I would
return soothingly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes?  Is that so?  It seemed to worry some of the
reporters; one came and asked me what I meant!  You
must make me learn it better next time."
</p>

<p>
Once he began to talk he confided all his thoughts to
me unreservedly, and the more freely that he had not
been worried to talk when he came in cold or tired.  He
used to say that it was such a relief to get right away from
the House when a sitting was over, and he enjoyed the
drive down to Eltham in a hansom cab every night or early
morning.  It was only an eight-miles drive, but part of it
was then very pleasant, through country lanes and over
a common.  Now London has swallowed up most of these
pretty bits.
</p>

<p>
After relieving his mind of all political affairs of the
day he would talk of things that were of home interest to
us&mdash;of his stone quarries at Arklow, his saw-mills, etc.,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
of what Kerr, his Irish agent, was doing at Avondale;
or of some of his hobbies at home.  So we would talk till
daylight sent pale gleams of light under the window
curtains, and he would say: "I am really sleepy, Queenie;
I'll go to bed," and as a rule he would sleep soundly until
about four o'clock in the afternoon, when he would come
down to breakfast in my sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
Parnell was always generous in letting any members
of his Party speak when they had a chance of distinguishing
themselves, and he would at once give way when he
thought any member could speak better on any subject
than himself.  This most of his Party, if not all, acknowledged
at one time.  I mention the characteristic because
I have noticed in more than one of the so-called "Lives"
written by those strangely ignorant of the man's real
character, that considerable stress is laid upon Parnell's
jealousy.  He was jealous, abnormally so where his
affections were concerned, but not in political life.
</p>

<p>
Gladstone once said that "Parnell always knew what
he wanted to say, and said it," but he was not a ready
speaker, and his constitutional nervousness, hidden though
it was under the iron mask of reserve he always wore in
public, rendered public speaking very painful work to him.
He was extremely modest about his own speeches, and
frequently would say to me that So-and-so "would have
put that much better to the House, but I could not have
trusted him to say it and leave it."  He considered that
most Irishmen spoilt things by over-elaboration.  Here
also I may record a protest at the tales of gross discourtesies,
spoken utterly without motive, recorded in some of
these "Lives."
</p>

<p>
The Parnell I knew&mdash;and I may claim to have known
him more intimately than anyone else on earth, both in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
public and private life&mdash;was incapable of such motiveless
brusqueries.  That Parnell could crush utterly and without
remorse I know; that he could deal harshly, even brutally,
with anyone or anything that stood against him in the path
he meant to tread, I admit; but that he would ever go out
of his way to say a grossly rude thing or make an
unprovoked attack, whether upon the personal appearance,
morals, or character of another man, I absolutely deny.
Parnell was ruthless in all his dealings with those who
thwarted his will, but&mdash;he was never petty.
</p>

<p>
Parnell had a most beautiful and harmonious voice
when speaking in public.  Very clear it was, even in
moments of passion against his own and his country's
foes&mdash;passion modulated and suppressed until I have seen,
from the Ladies' Gallery, his hand clenched until the
"Orders of the Day" which he held were crushed into
pulp, and only that prevented his nails piercing his hand.
Often I have taken the "Orders" out of his pocket, twisted
into shreds&mdash;a fate that also overtook the slips of notes
and the occasional quotations he had got me to look out
for him.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes when he was going to speak I could not
leave my aunt long enough to be sure of getting to the
Ladies' Gallery in time to hear him; or we might think it
inexpedient that I should be seen to arrive so soon after
him at the House.  On these occasions, when I was able,
I would arrive perhaps in the middle of his speech and
look down upon him, saying in my heart, "I have come!";
and invariably I would see the answering signal&mdash;the lift
of the head and lingering touch of the white rose in his
coat, which told me, "I know, my Queen!"
</p>

<p>
This telepathy of the soul, intuition, or what you
will, was so strong between us that, whatever the business
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
before the House, whether Parnell was speaking or not,
in spite of the absolute impossibility of distinguishing any
face or form behind the grille of the Ladies' Gallery,
Parnell was aware of my presence, even though often he
did not expect me, as soon as I came in, and answered
my wordless message by the signal that I knew.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes he would wish to speak to me before I went
home, and would signal by certain manipulations of his
handkerchief to me to go and await him at Charing Cross,
or another of our meeting-places, and there he would come
to me to tell me how things were going, or to chat for a
few minutes, or get from me the replies to messages sent
through me to Mr. Gladstone.

HOBBIES AND A CHALLENGE

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the early summer of 1881 my aunt had one of her old
friends to stay with her, and I seized the opportunity of
freedom to take my children to Brighton for a month,
after settling the old ladies together.  I had gone down
before the children to take rooms for them, and was
walking across Brighton Station when I was suddenly joined
by a tall man whom I did not recognize for a moment
until he said quietly, "Don't you know me?"  It was
Mr. Parnell, who had slipped into the train at Clapham
Junction, knowing that I was going to Brighton, and
had cut off his beard with his pocket scissors in the train
in order to avoid being recognized at Brighton.  He had
wrapped a white muffler round his throat, and pulled it
as high as possible over the lower part of his face, with the
result that the manageress of the hotel he stayed at was
certain that he had an infectious illness of the throat, and
rather demurred at letting him in.  It was only by the
expedient of complaining loudly at being kept waiting
in the draught with his "raging toothache" that
"Mr. Stewart" was reluctantly admitted.  I could not bear his
appearance neither bearded nor shaven&mdash;so he went off
soon after arrival, was properly shaved, and relieved the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
hotel staff by discarding the muffler and assuring
them that he was free from pain now his "tooth" was
out.
</p>

<p>
He went to Cork soon after this and, to please me, was
photographed without his beard and with the ring I had
given him on his finger.  We had had a little quarrel, and
were very unhappy until we had made it up again, and
he had this photograph done to remind me that he wore
my ring.  He also gave sittings to Henry O'Shea (no
relation of Captain O'Shea) for a portrait (pencil) at this
time, and this was sent to him while he was in Kilmainham.
He liked this sketch much, and wrote to the paper
for which it was done to this effect.  When he left the
prison he brought this sketch home to me, and I have it
now.  It hung in our dining-room till he died, and he
always liked it, but I still think it a little hard and
expressionless; the eyes are too large and empty.  There was
a painting done of Parnell years afterwards, and here also
the artist failed with the eyes.  This latter portrait was not,
I think, done from life, but from photographs, so there
was reason for the failure in this respect, photographs
making unsatisfactory studies.  The artist who painted this
last picture gave Parnell blue eyes; presumably following
the idea that Parnell was an Irishman, and must therefore
have blue eyes, whereas the facts were that Parnell was
not an Irishman, but the son of an Englishman resident in
Ireland and his American wife, and had brown eyes, not
large, but with the smouldering fires in them that gave
character to his cold, high-bred face.
</p>

<p>
Parnell had so many hobbies and interests in his home
life that it is difficult to enumerate them all.  He once said
rather wearily that if he had not "taken off his coat" in
the Irish cause and for the Irish people he could have been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
always happy at home working at things so much more
congenial to him.
</p>

<p>
At one time he took up all the intricacies of bookkeeping
in order that he might check his Irish agent's
accounts, and many weeks he sat immersed in double
entry, estate accounts keeping, commercial booking, etc.,
in the evening, while I sat near him typing replies to his
letters ready for his signature.  He used to threaten me
with lessons in book-keeping, so that I might be ready to
help him with the estate management at Avondale when
we went to live there; but I felt that my duties as his extra
and most private secretary were sufficiently arduous, and
declined instruction in account-keeping.
</p>

<p>
Many hours were also spent in architectural drawings,
which interested him greatly.  At that time Brighton
Station was being rebuilt, and Parnell was intensely
interested in getting the "span" of the roof.  He spent
hours at odd times pacing the station, measuring
distances, heights, depth of roof, etc., etc., and in drawing
up plans in order that he might build a cattle shed on the
same lines at Avondale.  These plans he afterwards
submitted to a well-known architect for his opinion on them,
and they were returned as absolutely correct in every
detail.  He then reduced the whole thing to scale
and had the cattle shed made from these plans at
Avondale.
</p>

<p>
I well remember his look of reproach at me when I
laughed while reading him a letter from his agent at
Avondale the following winter.  The agent said that Mrs. Delia
Parnell (Parnell's mother) had arrived unexpectedly at
Avondale, and, after seeing the new cattle shed, had at
once decided to give an entertainment in it.  This she had
done, having the cattle shifted from their comfortable
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
quarters, the place boarded in, and a temporary floor laid
down.
</p>

<p>
Parnell did not see that this expensive and troublesome
eviction of his cattle for so frivolous a reason was
in the least funny, and was very greatly annoyed at the
whole proceeding.  He was always most chivalrously kind
to his mother, however, and his protest on this occasion
was very gentle, though coupled with firm insistence,
on the instant restoration of the cattle-house to its
tenants.
</p>

<p>
Another of his hobbies was the "assaying" of small
pieces of quartz from the stream at Wicklow, and I used
to help him for hours at this, keeping his blow-pipe
constantly at work, while he, silent and absorbed,
manipulated the crucibles.  When we went to live at Brighton,
after my aunt's death, he had a furnace fitted up in one
of the rooms so that he could work on a larger scale.  His
endeavour to obtain gold from this quartz was rewarded
to a certain extent; but the working was, of course, far
too laborious and expensive to be profitable otherwise than
as a hobby.  However, Parnell for five years worked at it
in various odd hours till he had extracted sufficient gold
to line my wedding ring, even though his hope of getting
enough for the whole ring was not fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
When working at these things Parnell was absolutely
oblivious to the passing of time, and it was with difficulty
that I prevailed upon him to take sufficient exercise, or
even to take his meals before they were spoiled by waiting.
He would order his horse, "President," to be taken to a
certain place about a half-mile from the house, at the hour
he wished to ride, and then become so absorbed in the
particular hobby of the moment that even I could get
nothing from him but an abstracted smile and a gentle
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
"Is that so?" in answer to the intimation that his horse
had been waiting some two hours or more for him.
</p>

<p>
Many a day I have let him work up to the last
possible moment, and then literally pulled off the old
"cardigan" jacket he worked in, and forced him into his
frock-coat for the House; and it happened more than
once that he was due to attend a meeting in Ireland, and
when I had packed his things and had the carriage at the
door ready for him he would throw himself into a chair
and with his slow, grave smile say, "You are in a hurry
to get rid of me; I will not go yet.  Sit down and let me
look at you a bit, my Queen."  I would protest that he
must go, that he would lose the mail train.  "Then I'll be
no use at the meeting, for it will be over!" he would
mockingly reply; and so, when the last possible chance
of his being in time had vanished, he would sit opposite
me through the evening talking of politics, Avondale, the
assaying&mdash;of anything that came into his head always
watching me with that intent, considering gaze that was
my bewilderment and my joy.
</p>

<p>
When he failed a meeting like this, where hundreds of
people were waiting for him&mdash;or other appointments,
private or public&mdash;I sometimes would want him to telegraph,
or write, apologizing or excusing his non-attendance,
but this he would never do, saying, "You do not
learn the ethics of kingship, Queenie.  Never explain,
never apologize"; adding, with his rare laugh: "I could
never keep my rabble together if I were not above the
human weakness of apology."
</p>

<p>
When Parnell came home from Ireland after these
meetings he would sit smoking and watching me as I
went through the pockets of the coats he had worn while
away.  It was a most interesting game, and he enjoyed it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
as much as I when I brought out a new trophy from the
depths of the deepest and most obvious side pocket.  It
was a point of honour that he should not "feel or look"
till he got home to me, and I have a dear little collection of
souvenirs now from these pockets&mdash;little medals with the
images of various saints, scapulars and badges, slipped in
by the deft, modest fingers of sweet-faced nuns, in the
crowds, whose startled, deprecating blushes when he
turned and caught the delinquent in the act always won
a courteous bow and smile from the heretic "Chief" whose
conversion their patriotic hearts so ardently desired.  I
found also odds and ends pressed upon him by the
hero-worshipping peasants, some gruesome scrap of the rope
that had hanged some unknown scamp and hero, so
"aising to the bone-pains, an' his riv'rance not looking, a
bit of a twisht roun' yer honour's arrm!" or perhaps a
flattened old bullet that had gained some fancied power
in its evil journey through a man's heart.  Then there
were the brand-new kerchiefs of most vivid green, most
beautifully embroidered by the clever fingers of
"herself," and so many four-leaved, and therefore "lucky,"
shamrocks from the "colleens," who went singing all
the year if they thereby earned a smile from the Chief.
Even the little children used to make sudden, shy offerings
to their hero; a "quare bit ave a stone," a "farden me
mither giv me," or some uneasy looking fragment of what
might once have been a bird's egg.  Of sticks, blackthorns
and others, I once had an enormous collection
brought back to me at various times by Parnell, but these,
together with the two riding-whips I had myself given
him, were stolen from me some ten years ago, when I
was moving from one house to another.  The two riding-whips
I prized very highly, for Parnell was so pleased
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
when I gave them to him.  One was gold-mounted, the
other silver-mounted, and each had "C.S.P." engraved
upon it.
</p>

<p>
Among my stick collection was one made of horn&mdash;a
curious thing, carved and inlaid with ivory, sent him by
some unknown American admirer.  He used this stick on
his last journey upstairs from the sitting-room to the bed
where he died.
</p>

<p>
In January of 1881, Willie, who had rooms then in
Charles Street, Haymarket, came down to Eltham
suddenly, very angry indeed with me because he had seen
some men watching his lodgings, and imagined that I
had engaged a detective to do so.  As I had never had
an idea of doing anything of the sort I was extremely
annoyed, and a violent quarrel was the result.  As a
matter of fact, the men were watching the upper floor,
where a friend of Willie's lived, and this friend's wife
afterwards divorced him.
</p>

<p>
All these months, since my first meeting with Mr. Parnell,
Willie knew at least that I frequently met him
at the House.  He had invited him to Eltham himself,
though when the visit was first proposed I said my house
was too shabby, the children would worry so nervous a
man and we had better not break the routine of our
(Willie's and my) life (which by then was tacitly accepted
as a formal separation of a friendly sort) giving any and
every excuse, because of the danger I knew I was not
able to withstand.
</p>

<p>
But Willie was blind to the existence of the fierce,
bewildering force that was rising within me in answer to
call of those passion-haunted eyes, that waking or
sleeping never left me.  Willie then, as always, was
content that what was his, was his for good or ill.  He knew
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
that men, in our past life together, had admired me, even
that some had loved me; but that was to their own
undoing, an impertinence that had very properly recoiled
upon their own heads.  His wife could not love anyone
but himself; perhaps unfortunately she did not even do
that, but after all "love" was only a relative term&mdash;a little
vulgar even, after girlhood had passed, and the mild
affection of his own feelings towards her were no doubt
reciprocated, in spite of the unfortunate temperamental
differences that made constant companionship impossible.
</p>

<p>
So Parnell came, having in his gentle, insistent way
urged his invitation, and from Willie.  And now Willie
and I were quarrelling because he, my lawful husband,
had come down without the invitation that was now (for
some years) understood as due to the courtesy of friends,
and because he had become vaguely suspicious.  Flying
rumours had perhaps reached his ears; and now it was
too late, for he dared not formulate them, they were too
vague; too late, for I had been swept into the avalanche
of Parnell's love; too late, for I possessed the husband of
my heart for all eternity.
</p>

<p>
I had fought against our love; but Parnell would not
fight, and I was alone.  I had urged my children and
his work; but he answered me: "For good or ill, I am
your husband, your lover, your children, your all.  And
I will give my life to Ireland, but to you I give my love,
whether it be your heaven or your hell.  It is destiny.
When I first looked into your eyes I knew."
</p>

<p>
When Willie arrived so suddenly at Eltham Mr. Parnell
was not there, but Willie went into his room, and
finding his portmanteau, sent it to London, and left my
house, declaring he would challenge Parnell to fight a duel
and would shoot him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
</p>

<p>
"My dear Mrs. O'Shea," wrote Parnell from London
on the 7th of January, "will you kindly ask Captain
O'Shea where he left my luggage?  I inquired at both
parcel office, cloak-room, and this hotel at Charing Cross
to-day, and they were not to be found."
</p>

<p>
Willie later challenged Parnell, sending The O'Gorman
Mahon to him as his second; but the duel was not fought.
My sister, Mrs. Steele, came down to see me, and patched
up a peace between myself and Willie; and Mr. Parnell,
while making arrangements to go abroad to meet Willie,
explained to him that he (Parnell) must have a medium
of communication between the Government and himself,
that Mrs. O'Shea had kindly undertaken the office for him,
and, as this would render negotiations possible and safe,
he trusted that Willie would make no objection to his
meeting her after the duel.
</p>

<p>
"I replied to Captain O'Shea's note yesterday," writes
Parnell, "and sent my reply by a careful messenger to the
Salisbury Club; and it must be waiting him there.
</p>

<p>
"He has just written me a very insulting letter, and I
shall be obliged to send a friend to him if I do not have
a satisfactory reply to a second note I have just sent
him."
</p>

<p>
Willie then thought he had been too hasty in his
action, and, knowing I had become immersed in the Irish
cause, merely made the condition that Mr. Parnell should
not stay at Eltham.
</p>

<p>
From the date of this bitter quarrel Parnell and I were
one, without further scruple, without fear, and without
remorse.
</p>

<p>
The following are "cypher" letters of private messages
to me bearing upon the matter of the threatened
duel:&mdash;

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br />
ASTRONOMY, "SEDITION," AND ARREST
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"<i>&mdash;and there is one stirring hour ... when a wakeful influence
goes abroad over the sleeping hemisphere....  Do the stars rain
down an influence?</i>"&mdash;ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
During his leisure moments at Eltham Mr. Parnell took
up the study of astronomy with the vigour that always
characterized him when he was interested in a subject.
He had picked out from my bookshelf a book of stars&mdash;one
of Sir Robert Ball's, I believe, that I had bought at
random one day, and became at once interested.  From the
teaching of an old friend of my father's I had a fairly
good knowledge of astronomy, and, though by no means
well up in the latest research and discoveries, I was able
to tell him much of the stellar systems that was new to
him.  Finding how he devoured the little book of Sir
Robert Ball's, I got several of the latter's interesting works
for him, besides Herschel's.
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Parnell told me of a magnificent telescope
he had at Avondale, and sent for it.  When this arrived
he sent for a few sacks of Portland cement, with which he
made a pedestal in my garden, and himself mounted the
telescope upon it.  He made an ingenious arrangement
whereby the slightest touch would tilt the telescope to the
desired angle, and we spent many nights, he and I, watching
the stars and following the courses of the planets till
they faded in the dawn.  Then he thought of how near to
us was the Observatory at Greenwich, and got a permit to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
go over the Observatory.  After that, on the days when
my aunt had her readers with her, I used to accompany
him to the Observatory, where we spent many hours.
</p>

<p>
He could always absorb very quickly any knowledge that
appealed to him, and he soon had the pleasure of teaching
me much about the latest discoveries, and about a subject
intensely interesting to him&mdash;the wonderful way in which
the telescopes used in the great observatories of the world
are made.
</p>

<p>
In time this study of the stars began to worry him too
much, and he reluctantly gave up all serious work on the
subject.  He said it was all too immense and absorbing to
think about in a life that was primarily concerned with
politics.  But the pedestal remained, and still we occasionally
mounted the telescope and kept vigil with the stars
through the summer night.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On April 7, 1881, Mr. Gladstone had introduced his
Land Bill into the House of Commons.  It was a better
Bill than the Irish Party had reason to expect, but it had
grave defects, and the Irish had not been consulted; while
the Government's policy of coercion and Forster's attitude
towards Parnell and his followers made co-operation
between the Liberals and the Irish impossible.  Parnell's
policy was to hold aloof and press for amendments.  After
being crippled in the House of Lords the Bill became law.
At a Land League Convention held in Dublin on September
14 a resolution was adopted, on the suggestion of
Parnell, that the Act should be tested by selected cases.
"Nothing," said Parnell, "could be more disastrous to our
cause or our organization, and to your hopes of getting
your rents reduced, than an indiscriminate rush of the
tenantry into the Land Courts."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
</p>

<p>
A few days later Parnell was drawn in triumph through
the streets of Dublin.  The same day Forster wrote to
Gladstone suggesting that Parnell should be arrested
under the Coercion Act.
</p>

<p>
He suggested, moreover, that in his next speech at
Leeds, on October 7, Mr. Gladstone should impeach
Parnell and his policy.  Gladstone obeyed.  The people
of Ireland, he cried, wished to use the Land Act and
Parnell would not let them, but "the resources of
civilisation were not yet exhausted."
</p>

<p>
Parnell retorted with passion and scorn in his famous
Wexford speech delivered on October 9.[<a id="chap13fn1text"></a><a href="#chap13fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Suppose they arrest you, Mr. Parnell," asked an
Irish member, who dined with the Leader on the evening
of the speech, "have you any instructions to give us?
Who will take your place?"  "Ah!" he said, deliberately,
looking through a glass of champagne which he had just
raised to his lips.  "Ah, if I am arrested Captain
Moonlight will take my place."[<a id="chap13fn2text"></a><a href="#chap13fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
All through 1881 Parnell was constantly paying flying
visits to Ireland, and also to various parts of England,
working up the "League," addressing meetings and
privately ascertaining for himself how far the temper of
the "reactionaries" could be trusted to do the work he
wished without becoming too greatly involved in the tactics
of the "Invincibles" proper.  He came home to me now
always between the times of his journeyings up and down
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
the country, and if it was not certain that I should be alone
he would write me a formal though friendly note or letter
that anyone could have been shown, in which was given
some word or sign that let me know a place or time of
meeting him, either in London or nearer my home.  On
some of these occasions my duties to my aunt would keep
me, so that I might be an hour or more late in arriving
at the place where he awaited me; but never once in all
those years did he once fail me or leave the place of
appointment before I came, even though it might be at
the loss of the mail train to Ireland, and leaving some
thousands of people waiting in vain for the speech he was
too far away to make.  Sometimes I would become
conscience-stricken on such an occasion, but he would only
comment that one speech more or less was a little matter,
and what was lost by a speech not made was amply
compensated for by the deepened impression of his mystery
and power gained by the people.  "For it is the strange
thing I found out early in political life," he would say,
"they think I'm much more wonderful when I do nothing
than when I'm working hard."

<p>
On October 12th, 1881, I was in London on Mr. Parnell's
business&mdash;to ascertain the movements of the
Government.  He, of course, was in Ireland and had
warned me that it would be impossible for him to keep out
of prison much longer, and that any further effort to avoid
arrest would be inexpedient on all counts.  I was much
depressed about this and urged him to put it off as long
as possible.
</p>

<p>
My health was then delicate, and I felt an unreasonable
fear and loneliness when he was away from me.  He was
very tender and considerate to me, but pointed out that
the turmoil and rebellion he had brought to a head in
Ireland must be very carefully handled to be productive
of ultimate good, and that he could "mark time" with the
Land League better in Kilmainham than out, thus rendering
this force more useful to the Home Rule campaign and
less wanton in destruction.  Parnell used, but never
abused, the weapons of political strife he forged.
</p>

<p>
He desired immediate information of the decision of
the Government to arrest him, that he might destroy any
papers that, found on him, might frustrate his plans and
cause unnecessary difficulty to those working with him.
So when on October 12th information was sent to me, at
the house where I waited in London in the neighbourhood
of Piccadilly, that a Cabinet Council had been hurriedly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
summoned, I wired in code to Parnell and directly after
the Cabinet Council I was able to inform him that Forster
had left for Ireland with the warrant for his arrest.
</p>

<p>
I could not bear the thought of his arrest, and after
writing to him under cover to a person in Ireland who
would, I knew, get my letter to him, whether in or out
of prison, I telegraphed to Parnell again to know if he
could meet me at Holyhead if I started at once.  I had so
much of his business in hand now, and he had expected to
see me at least once more before the inevitable separation
of his imprisonment.  I felt almost unable to cope with
the situation; I was not strong and I was full of anxiety
as to the probable effects upon Parnell's health of life in
Kilmainham Gaol.  In addition to my anxiety, the deception
I had to practise towards Captain O'Shea, seldom as
I saw him, told upon my nerves just now.  However,
Parnell's message in reply, written in our private code,
reassured me.  While he still thought it better to suffer
arrest at once, he would not go out of his way to meet it,
and would be careful when in Kilmainham so that his
imprisonment should be of short duration.  He would
not allow me to go to the fatigue of a journey to Holyhead,
nor would he go abroad to avoid arrest, and I went home
comforting myself as I could with his confident spirit and
loving messages.
</p>

<p>
On October 13th there was a terrible gale throughout
the South of England, and at Eltham, after a sleepless
night, I was up early&mdash;far too early to disturb my old
aunt&mdash;and wandered out through her park in the gale.  The
battling with the wind lifted a little the load of restlessness
and anxiety as to what was happening in Ireland from my
heart.
</p>

<p>
I was with my aunt as usual all that day, and was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
glad of the quiet and rest.  The old lady gazed out at
the still raging storm and told me tales of her youth,
while I listened to the voice I loved in the wind outside,
saying to me again and again what he had said before
he left me, "Be brave, Queenie.  I cannot stay outside
while all these others are arrested, and it is bound to be
soon now."
</p>

<p>
Towards evening, when the storm had cleared a little,
and my aunt had fallen asleep before the fire, I went home
to get the evening papers I always had sent over from
Blackheath before Willie came down from London to
dinner, as he had written to say he would do.  However,
on my return home I found Willie already there, extremely
pleased to be able to announce to me that Parnell had
been arrested that morning.  I knew his news directly I
saw his face, and as I was really prepared for it I did not
flinch, but replied languidly that I had thought Parnell
"couldn't keep out of gaol much longer, didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
But Willie was so fiercely and openly joyful that my
maids, who were ardent Parnellites, were much shocked,
and I, being terribly overwrought, laughed at their
disgusted faces as I went to dress for dinner.  It was really
the laugh of tears, but that laugh of jangled nerves and
misery did me good service with Willie, and we got
through dinner amicably enough, while he descanted upon
the wickedness and folly of Parnell's policy and the way
the Irish question should really be settled, and would be
if it could be left to him and those who thought with
him.  He observed me closely, as he criticised Parnell and
his policy, and reiterated his pleasure in knowing he was
"laid by the heels."
</p>

<p>
I was now quite calm again, and smiled at him as I
reminded him that I was now as ardent a Parnellite as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
Parnell himself, and had already done so much hard work
for "the cause" that my politics were far more reactionary
that when he had introduced Parnell to me: unlike his
(Willie's) own, which were less so.  My heart being in
Kilmainham Gaol with my lover, I was momentarily at
peace, and could ask Willie questions as to the mode of
life and prison discipline of political prisoners.  Willie, as
are so many men, was never so happy as when giving
information.
</p>

<p>
The next day I received my King's letter, written as
he was arrested:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">
  MORRISON'S HOTEL, DUBLIN,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>October 13</i>, 1881.<br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
MY OWN QUEENIE,&mdash;I have just been arrested by two fine-looking
detectives, and write these words to wifie to tell her
that she must be a brave little woman and not fret after her
husband.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The only thing that makes me worried and unhappy is
that it may hurt you and our child.
</p>

<p class="letter">
You know, darling, that on this account it will be wicked
of you to grieve, as I can never have any other wife but you,
and if anything happens to you I must die childless.  Be good
and brave, dear little wifie, then.  YOUR OWN HUSBAND.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Politically it is a fortunate thing for me that I have been
arrested, as the movement is breaking fast, and all will be
quiet in a few months, when I shall be released.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Speaking at the Guildhall on the day of Parnell's
arrest Mr. Gladstone said: "Within these few minutes
I have been informed that towards the vindication of the
law, of order, of the rights of property, and the freedom
of the land, of the first elements of political life and
civilization, the first step has been taken in the arrest of the
man who has made himself pre-eminent in the attempt
to destroy the authority of the law, and substitute what
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
would end in being nothing more than anarchical
oppression exercised upon the people of Ireland."
</p>

<p>
When he uttered the word "arrest" he was stopped
by the audience rising en masse and cheering frantically.
"Parnell's arrest"&mdash;I quote from the "Life of Forster"&mdash;"was
hailed almost as though it had been the news of a
signal victory gained by England over a hated and
formidable enemy."
</p>

<p>
Sexton, O'Kelly, Dillon, O'Brien, and J. P. Quinn,
secretary of the League, were quickly arrested, while
warrants were issued for Biggar, Healy, and Arthur
O'Connor.  Healy was in England, and Biggar and
O'Connor managed to join him there.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap13fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap13fn1text">1</a>] Parnell in this speech vigorously attacked Gladstone's policy, calling
him a "masquerading knight-errant" and a champion of the liberties
of every nation except Ireland.  He pointed out that Gladstone had a
good word for the late Isaac Butt, and added scornfully that "in the
opinion of an English statesman no man was good in Ireland until he
was buried."  By implication he challenged the Government to arrest him
under the Coercion Act.

CHAPTER XIV
<br />
KILMAINHAM DAYS
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>Love is not a flower that grows on the dull earth;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springs by the calendar; must wait for the sun.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * * * *<br />
  E'en while you look the peerless flower is up<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consummate in the birth.</i>"&mdash;J. S. KNOWLES.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At the news of the arrest a wave of indignation swept
through Ireland.  In Dublin there were riots.  In many
places shops were closed and towns and villages went into
mourning as if for the death of a king.
</p>

<p>
Five days later the Land League countered the arrest
by issuing the No Rent manifesto.
</p>

<p>
Parnell was really opposed to it.  Dillon openly so,
but the majority of the leaders then in Kilmainham Gaol
approved of it, and it was signed and published in <i>United
Ireland</i> on October 17th.  The signature is interesting, it
runs thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Charles S. Parnell, President, Kilmainham Gaol; A. J. Kettle,
Honorary Secretary, Kilmainham Gaol; Michael Davitt,
Honorary Secretary, Portland Prison; Thomas Brennan,
Honorary Secretary, Kilmainham Gaol; Thomas Geston, Head
Organizer, Kilmainham Gaol; Patrick Egan, Treasurer, Paris."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Meanwhile arrests and evictions went on all over
Ireland, and the Coercion Act was used mercilessly and
unscrupulously on behalf of the landlords.  The Ladies'
Land League and its president, Miss Anna Parnell,
became very busy.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
</p>

<p>
From the time of Parnell's arrest onward until the
birth of his child in the following February I lived a
curiously subconscious existence; pursuing the usual
routine of my life at home and with my aunt, but feeling
that all that was of life in me had gone with my lover to
prison, and only came back to me in the letters that were
my only mark of time.  I had to be careful now; Willie
became solicitous for my health, and wished to come to
Eltham more frequently than I would allow.  He thought
February would seal our reconciliation, whereas I knew it
would cement the cold hatred I felt towards him, and
consummate the love I bore my child's father.

I am very comfortable here, and have a beautiful room

I feel lonely.  My only fear is about my darling Queenie.  I

MY OWN DARLING QUEENIE,&mdash;I have just received your
charming little letter of Tuesday, which I have been anxiously
expecting for the last week.  It has taken an enormous load
off my mind.  I shall send you a long letter to-morrow or next
day, but for the present you had better not come over, as
there are five or six other men in rooms adjacent to mine who
find out about everybody who visits me.  Besides, you would
not be permitted to see me except in presence of two warders,
and it might only make you more unhappy.
</p>

<p class="letter">
You must not be alarmed about rumours that the Government
have evidence that we are involved in a treasonable
conspiracy.  There is absolutely no foundation whatever for
such a statement, and it is only made to defend their own

<p class="letter">

<p class="letter">
<i>October</i> 21, 1881.
</p>

<p class="letter">
MY OWN DARLING WIFIE,&mdash;I wrote you a short note this
afternoon, which I succeeded in getting off safely.  Now after
we have been all locked up safely for the night, and when
everything is quiet and I am alone, I am going to send
my own Queenie some news.  But first I must tell you that
I sleep exceedingly well, and am allowed to read the
newspapers in bed in the morning, and breakfast there also, if
I wish.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I want, however, to give you a little history from the
commencement of my stay here.
</p>

<p class="letter">
When I heard that the detectives were asking for me a terror&mdash;one
which has often been present with me in anticipation&mdash;fell
upon me, for I remembered that my darling had told me
that she feared it would kill her; and I kept the men out of
my room while I was writing you a few hasty words of comfort
and of hope, for I knew the shock would be very terrible
to my sweet love.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I feared that I could not post it, but they stopped the cab
just before reaching the prison and allowed me to drop the
letter into a pillar-box.  My only torture during those first
few days was the unhappiness of my queen.  I wired Mrs. S. to
know how you were, but the wire was sent back with a note
that it could not be delivered as she had gone to R.  Finally
your first letter came, and then I knew for the first time that
you were safe.  You must not mind my being in the infirmary.
I am only there because it is more comfortable than being
in a cell, and you have longer hours of association, from 8 a.m. to
8 p.m., instead of being locked up at 6 and obliged to eat by
yourself.  The infirmary is a collection of rooms, and each
has a room to himself&mdash;Dillon is in a cell, but he is allowed as
a special privilege to come over and associate with us during
the daytime.  I am obliged to invent little maladies for
myself from day to day in order to give Dr. Kenny an excuse
for keeping me in the infirmary, but I have never felt better in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
my life.  Have quite forgotten that I am in prison, and should
very much miss the rattle of the keys and the slam of the doors.
The latest discovery is heart affection.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The only thing I don't like is that the Government insist
upon sending a lot of police into the gaol every night, two of
whom sleep against my door and two more under my window.
Just at present we are all in great disgrace on account of the
manifesto, and the poor warders have been most of them
dismissed and fresh ones brought in.  A very strict watch
is kept, and I have been obliged to exert my ingenuity to get
letters out to you and to get yours in return.  If Wifie is very
good and becomes strong and happy again I may let her come
over and see me after a time, but for five days more I am not
to be allowed to see any visitor, but I will write you again
about your coming.  They have let us off very easily.  I fully
expected that we should have been scattered in different gaols
through the country as a punishment, but they evidently think
no other place safe enough for me.  Indeed, this place is not
safe, and I can get out whenever I like, but it is probably the
best policy to wait to be released.  And now good-night, my
own dear little Wifie.  Promise your husband that you will
sleep well and look as beautiful when we meet again as the
last time I pressed your sweet lips.  YOUR OWN HUSBAND.

<p class="letter">
My esteemed friend Mr. Forster has become very disagreeable
lately.  He refuses to allow me to see my solicitor
except in presence and hearing of two warders, so I have
declined to see him at all.  He also refuses to allow me to see
visitors except in the cage, which I have also declined to do,
but probably things may be relaxed again after a time.&mdash;Yours
very truly, C. S. P.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Parnell had a certain visitor who was permitted to see
him in Kilmainham on his "necessary and private" business,
though not alone, and this gentleman was able to
take his letters out, and bring them to him, unobserved,
and after putting them into another outer envelope address
them to "Mrs. Carpenter" at an address in London,
whence I fetched them.  Or sometimes he would send
a formal letter to me at Eltham enclosing one addressed
to some political or other personage.  If Willie were at
Eltham I would show him this note asking me to post
enclosure on a certain date.  The enclosure was, of course,
to me&mdash;sent thus to keep me from the fatigue of going to
town so often.  The Governor of Kilmainham for some
reason became suspicious of Parnell's visitor, and forbade
his interviews except in the close proximity of two warders
selected by himself, and Parnell refused to see him at all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
under these restrictions.  He wrote me a friendly letter
then, telling me this, and other little news of his prison
life, as to an ordinary acquaintance, and addressed it
direct to Eltham, sending it to be approved by the Governor
and posted in the ordinary way.  In this letter, that
anyone might have seen, there was a message by a private
sign to go to the house in town for a letter within a few
days.  On doing so, I found my letter as usual, posted
by a friendly warder, and contained in it was a recipe for
invisible ink, and this ink could only be "developed" by
one particular formula, a combination known only to one
chemist.  We were saved an infinity of trouble and
anxiety, as we could now write between the lines of an
ordinary or typewritten letter without detection, and it was
no longer essential to get a third person to direct the
envelopes.  In time the Governor again became suspicious,
and the friendly warder was dismissed&mdash;or Parnell was
told so.  However, this was only a temporary inconvenience,
as Parnell was able in a couple of days to reorganize
his communications with me, and this time they were not
broken.

<p class="letter">
MY DARLING WIFIE,&mdash;When I received your dear letter
to-day I had just time to send you a few hasty lines in
acknowledgment; now when everything is quiet and with your own
sweet face before me I can give my thoughts up entirely to
my Queen, and talk to you almost as well as if you were in my
arms.  It seems to me a long, long time since our hasty good-bye,
although the first three weeks of my present life&mdash;which
term will have been completed to-morrow morning&mdash;has seemed
only a moment.  I often feel very sad when I think of poor,
unhappy Katie waiting for her husband who does not come
any longer as he used to come, but who will come again to her
and will not again leave her.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I am trying to make arrangements that my own Queenie
may come to me this time.  I shall ask my ruler here if I may
see my cousin, "Mrs. Bligh, who is coming from England to
see me," in his office, and with only himself present.  After all,
darling, the only way in which I could have escaped being
here would have been by going to America, and then I could
not have seen you at all, and I know I should not have been
so happy or so comfortable in America as here, and, besides,
I should have been beset by so many dangers there.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I admire supremely my life of ease, laziness, absence of
care and responsibility here.  My only trouble is about your
health and happiness and this has been my only trouble from
the first.  Queenie, then, will see that she also must try not to
be so unhappy, especially as her husband's love is becoming
stronger and more intense every hour and every day.
</p>

<p class="letter">
You will be anxious to know what my short illness was
about.  It was of a very unromantic kind&mdash;not the heart,
but the stomach.  I had not much appetite for some days,
and was tempted by a turkey to eat too much, thence very
severe indigestion and considerable pain for about an hour.
However "our doctor," by means of mustard and chlorodyne,
got me all right again, and my appetite is now as good as ever.
In fact, I have gotten over very quickly the "mal du prison"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
which comes on everybody sooner or later more or less
severely.
</p>

<p class="letter">
One of the men in this quarter who has been here for nearly
nine months, poor fellow, looks after me as if he was
my&mdash;brother, I was going to say, but I will substitute Mary.[<a id="chap14fn1text"></a><a href="#chap14fn1">1</a>]  He
makes me a soda and lemon in the morning, and then gives
me my breakfast.  At dinner he takes care that I get all the
nicest bits and concocts the most perfect black coffee in a
"Kaffee Kanne" out of berries, which he roasts and grinds
fresh each day.  Finally, in the evening, just before we are
separated for the night, he brews me a steaming tumbler of
hot whisky.  He has marked all my clothes for me also, and
sees that the washerwoman does not rob me.  Don't you
begin to feel quite jealous?
</p>

<p class="letter">
I am going to ask Katie to put her proper initials upon

I do not think there is the least probability of my being
moved; this is the strongest place they have, and they are

did not face the sun, but I refused, so they did not persist.

Our mutual friend is waiting for me at present, and probably

heard on good authority that they intend to move me to
Armagh the end of this week or beginning of next in order
to give me an opportunity of escaping while there.  However,
they may change their mind, and in any case it will
make no difference to me personally.  Armagh is healthier

<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>

suffering much also.

<p class="letter">
MY OWN QUEENIE,&mdash;I was very happy in receiving my
darling's letter of yesterday to-day.  My messenger was looking
very frightened, and fears his letters may be opened any
day.  So perhaps it will be safest for Wifie not to write again
for a few days, until I see further, or until I can manage
another address.  I can manage, however, to write my Queenie
two or three times a week.  You must not be frightened if
you see we have all gone on P. F.[<a id="chap14fn3text"></a><a href="#chap14fn3">3</a>]  It will not be so as far
as we are concerned here, and will only be for a week as regards
the others, but Wifie must not tell anybody that I have not
done so, as it would create discontent amongst the others.
The man who has been taking care of me is going out to-morrow,
and will be a loss to me.  He has been very ill during
the last week from bad sore throat, and was very nearly
suffocated the night before last, so I sent O'Gorman Mahon to
Forster about him, with the desired effect of getting his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
discharge.  One of the others will supply his place to me, but not
so well.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Have not been weighed yet, but will to-morrow.  I think
Wifie has my last weight.  After eight at night I read books,
newspapers, and write until about twelve or one, when I go
to bed.  I also think a good deal of my own darling during
that time when everything is quiet, and wonder how soon I
shall be with you again.

love, with your husband to make you happy.

My Queenie must take great care of herself, and must be
sure to have at least one doctor in February.  It will never
do to let it trust to chance.

MY OWN QUEENIE,&mdash;If Queenie could see her husband
reading her letters over and over again every night she would
have more faith in their readable quality and power for giving
her husband happiness than she can have in looking at the
blank paper as the result of her work.  The paper of that of
the 6th, which reached me to-day, is exactly suited; but Wifie,
in sending two sheets, one of them quite blank, makes a bad
conspirator, but I must forgive her, as the result is by no means
blank to me.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I do feel very anxious about you, my darling, and cannot
help it.  You must tell the doctor, and never mind about &mdash;&mdash;.
Could you not go to London or Brighton about the beginning
of February?  London would be best, if you could get him
away on any pretext; but if you could not, Brighton would
leave you most free from him.

It is perfectly dreadful that Wifie should be so worried at

<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
and bacon for breakfast, soup and chops for luncheon, and joint
and vegetables, etc., for dinner, and sometimes oysters.  The
"one meal a day" is only a pretence.  Each man gets £2
when arrested, and 15s. a week, and can feed himself as he
likes.  Most of them pocket the money and make the
Government feed them.  You can understand the unwillingness of
W.'s friend to leave under these circumstances.  The Government
food is much better now after the row about it, so most
of the men can manage very well with it, and send the 15s. home
or put it in bank.  I expect the majority of the Irish
people will be here after a time, the pay is so good and it is
quite a safe place.  I am very well, dearest Queenie, and

anything here for a long time to come.  Certainly until the
Coercion Act has expired I will not speak here again, so Queenie
need not be afraid that when she gets me again she will lose me.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I am disposed to think that Government at present intend
to release me shortly before opening of Parliament, but, of
course, they may change their mind and hasten or postpone
my release.  Anyhow, let Queenie's mind be quite at rest, I
am very well and am growing more vigorous every day, the
air and exercise in the new yard suiting me exactly.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I long very, very much to be with my own Wifie again,
and wish I could take care of and comfort her in the time

to her husband to give him this child, and to take such care
of it during this long, sad interval, but she must remember
that she is far more to me than all the world beside, and that
she must specially take care of herself, as her King cannot
now live without her.

I think Brighton will do very well if Wifie likes it, and if
it would be safe for her to be so far from London.  Her King
could be there quite well, as he intends to take a holiday when
released, and will not go to work at once.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Have just received formal and usual notice of further
detention, first three months being up.  The other two have
also received theirs.  This has no significance one way or the
other, as nobody has ever been released at the end of the
exact period.  My own Wifie must try and keep herself well
and strong.  Does she feel so?  I wish I could be with my

</p>

<p class="letter">
It is really the only reason why I wish for a change, and
my Queenie's loneliness and weariness makes me very unhappy.
Yesterday and to-day as three of us were exercising in
our yard the gates in adjoining yard leading into the outer
world were opened twice to permit some carts to come in and
go out.  A low wall only separated the two yards, across which
we could have easily sprung; there was no warder in our
yard, and only one in the next, with his back turned to us.
So, you see, we can get out whenever we want to.  Trying
to escape is six months with hard labour, so we have nothing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>

fear from it that you are going to distress and worry

exceedingly well, and am likely to remain so.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Notwithstanding the newspapers, it is most unlikely they
will keep us here till the commencement of session.  D., indeed,
will probably go out in a day or two on account of his health;
but in any case my Queenie must not think of worrying about
her husband, as he is very comfortable and happy where he is,
if he might only see his own Wifie sometimes.  I should feel
quite lonely now in London without being able to see my
darling, and I should very much prefer to stay here than to
be all alone in London while Wifie is suffering, except that I
know it would comfort her to have me even so near her.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I hope you have received my letter saying that I think
London or home the best for you, and not Brighton; the latter

<p class="letter">
MY OWN DARLING QUEENIE,&mdash;To-day I have written you
direct, sending a few words between the lines, just to see how
it will answer.  I find that rubbing with blotting paper after
the words are dry takes away any glistening or appearance of
letters.  My own Wifie had best not try writing direct here,
but send all her letters as usual, and continue to do so.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The note I have just written goes out through a warder, and
I think I shall always be able to manage in that way, but in
case Queenie should get a letter from me through the Governor
she will see it marked with his initials on the top left-hand
corner, and in that case she might write me a commonplace
letter direct here, but nothing between the lines.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Wifie is very good indeed to write her husband such beautiful
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
letters; if she only knew what a pleasure and happiness
every word from her is to her husband it might make her
feel a little less unhappy.  I am very much troubled about
my darling having become so thin, and fear that you have
suffered a great deal more than you have ever told me, and that
you are not strong.  I often reproach myself for having been
so cruel to my own love in staying so long away from her that
time, which has led to such a long, long separation.  I was
dragged into that Kildare engagement, otherwise I should
have been safe with Wifie.  Until then I had settled that I
should leave Ireland after Wexford.  It would, however, have
been very difficult for me to have kept out of the country
even if I had left then, and on the whole I hope it will turn
out all for the best.  At least, I am very glad that the days
of platform speeches have gone by and are not likely to return.
I cannot describe to you the disgust I always felt with those
meetings, knowing as I did how hollow and wanting in solidity
everything connected with the movement was.  When I was
arrested I did not think the movement would have survived
a month, but this wretched Government have such a fashion
for doing things by halves that it has managed to keep things
going in several of the counties up till now.  However, next
month, when the seeding time comes, will probably see the end
of all things and our speedy release.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I hope Wifie has got her house in London; I am exceedingly
anxious about those long journeys to London for you,
my own.  Your husband is very well indeed, and is, I think,
actually beginning to grow fat!
</p>

<p class="letter">
I think Queenie ought to congratulate me at being away
from the House instead of pitying me.

own little Wifie somewhere, and to listen to the waves breaking

My baby was born on February 16th, 1882.  I was
very ill, but the joy of possessing Parnell's child carried
me through my trouble.  She was a beautiful baby,
apparently strong and healthy&mdash;for the first few weeks&mdash;and
with the brown eyes of her father.  This child of tragedy
rarely cried, but lay watching me with eyes thoughtful
and searching beyond the possibility of her little life.  I
used to seek in hers for the fires always smouldering in
the depths of her father's eyes, but could not get beyond
that curious gravity and understanding in them, lightened
only by the little smile she gave when I came near.

I felt until your little note came that all was quite right.
I am very happy, my own, that our little daughter pleases
you, and that you are not too much disappointed, and that
she is strong and good-tempered.  Does Queenie think she
will be too big?  I shall love her very much better than if it

I have been arranging a little happiness, I hope, for

over here and can manage it.  I have been training up Captain
Barlow, the chairman of the Prisons Board, to allow me to
see my married sisters in private.  To-day I got him to give
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
me a private visit with one of them, Mrs. Dickinson, for the first
time, and I did so with the intention of passing Queenie off
as another married sister after a time.  Wifie will then be
able to come and see for herself how well her husband looks,
and how happy and comfortable he is.  I don't know whether
they intend to move me or not, and do not like to guess, but
wherever I go I shall be probably very well off.  The dusting
they got in the House the other night about treatment of the
rank and file will do them good.  I am told that all the police
in the King's County were drafted into Tullamore and put
into plain clothes to form an audience for Forster.  Shall

I was said to be most like of the family; but possibly it might
make suspicions.

I am very anxious about my darling going to London so
often; it must be very bad for you.  You may try your next
letter upon ordinary paper, unglazed, and do not crowd what
you write in ordinary ink into one little space in the middle of
the sheet.  After the solution has dried if you rub over the
letters with an ink eraser it will remove all the glistening and
appearance of letters.  I wonder they have never opened
any of them, but they may do it at any time.  It would not
hurt me in any way as I do not use it for any other purpose.
Unless, indeed, they sent it to a certain person.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Queenie must not be alarmed about stupid rumours in the
papers.  You know what these liners are, and the <i>Freeman</i>
agent in London is singularly stupid and badly informed.

MY OWN DEAREST WIFIE,&mdash;I think it very likely that something
will be done by the Government shortly on the arrears
question.  If this be so, things will undoubtedly quiet down
a great deal, and it will give us an opportunity of coming to
some arrangement.  I do not in the least apprehend that any
further steps will be taken against me in any case, though,
of course, they would eagerly grasp at the slightest thing in
order to try and throw discredit on me.
</p>

<p class="letter">
So far as I can judge, the number of outrages has diminished
very materially during the last two or three weeks, and
is likely to continue decreasing.
</p>

<p class="letter">
My own Wifie must remember that I was only 12 st. 2 lb. when
I came here, as I had fallen away very much after I left
her, and that I have got back 5 lb. since, notwithstanding
my illness, which left me very thin indeed.  Poor little Queenie
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
must be greatly troubled and anxious at all the rumours she
hears, but she need not regard any of them; she knows what
newspaper men are.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Give my best love and ever so many kisses to our little
daughter.  I am very much troubled about her health, and
hope it will not make her permanently delicate.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I am longing very very much to see my own Wifie.  I love
you, my darling, more and more every day, and I should feel
quite reconciled to giving up politics for ever and living with
my sweet Katie all by ourselves away from everybody and
everything.  I do not think anything will ever induce me
to speak from a platform again.  I always disliked it
excessively, but I should loathe it now.  Wifie must not, however,
suppose that I am annoyed with the way things have gone.
On the contrary, everything has succeeded remarkably, and
much better than anybody could have expected.

<p class="letter">
MY OWN DEAREST WIFIE,&mdash;I am so happy from receiving
your letter of the 5th to-day, although part of what you say
about our daughter makes me very anxious indeed.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I hope the poor little thing will soon get over it.  Her
hair is absolutely lovely.  I am so glad it is more like Queenie's
than mine, although there is enough of mine in it to spoil it
somewhat and render it less beautiful than Wifie's.  Still,
there is a splendid golden tint in it which is quite exceptional.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Wifie need not feel at all anxious about me or anything
which the Government are likely to do or be able to do.
Although there have been one or two bad events things are
getting much quieter every day.  D. is going abroad and will
not even appear in the House for a couple of months.  My
mother's health has, I fear, become very much broken latterly,
and after a time I think of applying to go over to see her, but
I must try and get O. K.[<a id="chap15fn5text"></a><a href="#chap15fn5">5</a>] out first.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I am still keeping very well, although have missed the
ball-playing very much for the last three weeks, as O. K.,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
who used to play with me, has been ill.  I think my weight
is very good considering the hard exercise I have been taking
and the good condition I am in.  I hope my precious one is
getting strong again and that she will have some good news
to tell me of our little daughter when she writes next.

<p>
I will not speak of my anguish when I found that the
child of my love was slowly dying, and that the doctors
I called in could do nothing for her.  Slowly she faded
from me, daily gaining in that far-reaching expression
of understanding that dying children have so strongly,
and my pain was the greater in that I feared her father
would never see her now.
</p>

<p>
Willie was very good; I told him my baby was dying
and I must be left alone.  He had no suspicion of the
truth, and only stipulated that the child should be
baptized at once&mdash;urged thereto, I think, by his mother and
sister.  I had no objection to this.  Parnell and I had
long before agreed that it would be safer to have the child
christened as a Catholic, and he had no feeling at all
against the Catholic religion, considering, indeed, that for
those who required a religion it was an admirable one.  I
made an altar of flowers in my drawing-room, as the
child was much too ill to be taken to church, and there
the priest, Father Hart, came and baptized Sophie Claude.
Sophie, after Parnell's sister, Claude, after Lord Truro,
an old friend of mine.
</p>

<p>
A few days before the death of my baby I had the
unspeakable comfort of knowing that Parnell could come
to me for a few hours and perhaps see his child while
she lived.  His nephew, son of his sister Delia
(Mrs. Thomson), had died in Paris, and the authorities gave
Parnell leave on "parole" to attend the young man's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
funeral.  A brilliant, handsome fellow, great sympathy
was felt with the parents of this only son.
</p>

<p>
Spring was very early that year, and in the April
morning when the air was fragrant with the sweet freshness
of the spring flowers and the very breath of life was
in the wind, Parnell came to me and I put his dying child
into his arms.
</p>

<p>
That evening he had to go on to Paris.

After his nephew's funeral he returned to Eltham,
having, before, telegraphed to Willie to say that he was
coming.  He wished to conciliate Willie as much as
possible, and believed that his politics might now prove
useful.
</p>

<p>
All that night of the 21st April Parnell and Willie
sat up in my dining-room discussing the Irish question,
and bit by bit working out the "Kilmainham Treaty."  Willie
wanted me to join them, but I would not leave my
baby, and when the daylight came and they went to lie
down for a few hours' rest before Parnell left for Ireland,
my little one died as my lover stole in to kiss us both and
say good-bye.

CHAPTER XVI
<br />
THE "KILMAINHAM TREATY"
</h3>

<p class="intro">
  "<i>Shall I say stipulation, King?</i>"<br />
  "<i>No, Queenie, he prefers 'suggestions desirable to be<br />
  entertained!</i>'"&mdash;EXTRACT FROM AN OLD DIARY.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Parnell, in accordance with his "parole," returned to
Kilmainham at the end of the term of leave and immediately
formulated the conditions of the arrangement it was
proposed to make with the Government.  The draft of
this historic document was as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"KILMAINHAM, April 25th, 1882.
</p>

<p>
"We think in the first place that no time should be
lost in endeavouring to obtain a satisfactory settlement
of the arrears question, and that the solution proposed in
the Bill standing for second reading to-morrow&mdash;Wednesday&mdash;would
provide a satisfactory solution, though the
Church Fund would have to be supplemented by a grant
from Imperial resources of probably a million or so.
</p>

<p>
"Next as regards the permanent amendment of the
Land Act, we consider that the rent-fixing clauses should
be amended to as great an extent as is possible, having
in view the necessity of passing an Amending Bill through
the House of Lords; that leaseholders who have taken
leases either before or since the Act of 1870 should be
permitted to apply to have a fair rent fixed, and that the
purchase clauses should be amended as suggested by the
Bill, the second reading of which will be moved by
Mr. Redmond to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
</p>

<p>
"If the Government were to announce their intention
of proposing a satisfactory settlement of the arrears
difficulty as indicated above, we on our part would make it
known that the No Rent manifesto was withdrawn, and
we should advise the tenants to settle with their landlords;
we should also then be in a better position than we
ever occupied before to make our exertions effective in
putting a stop to the outrages which are unhappily of
late so prevalent.
</p>

<p>
"If the result of the arrears settlement and the further
ameliorative measures suggested above were the material
diminution of outrages before the end of the session, and
the prospect of the return of the country after a time to
something like a normal condition, we should hope that
the Government would allow the Coercion Act to lapse,
and govern the country by the same laws as in England."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Willie wrote to Gladstone on April 13th, and two days
after Gladstone replied promising to communicate with
Forster.  The rest of the letter was taken up with compliments
to Willie, and some carefully-worded phrases which
really meant that Gladstone was prepared to go to very
great lengths indeed to quiet Ireland and to keep her
quiet.
</p>

<p>
Willie sent to Chamberlain a copy of his letter to
Gladstone.  Chamberlain was impressed and guarded.  He
welcomed negotiations, but pointed out that if the
Government were going to smile on the Irish Party the Irish
Party must smile on the Government.  With some
amount of exaggerated fervour he mooted the possibility
of an anti-Irish movement comparable with the anti-Semitic
movement abroad.  That, he pointed out, would
be bad for everybody, and accordingly he welcomed the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
olive branch.  In the sequel, of course, Chamberlain took
a very active part in pressing for the release of Parnell.
While on "parole," and after his return from Paris,
Parnell entered into communication with Mr. Justin
McCarthy with regard to the proposed "Treaty," and the
following letter was written from Eltham:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">

<p class="letter">

you will have some news of result of Cabinet to-day.&mdash;Yours
very truly, C. S. P.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

conversation, and which, if you think it desirable, you might
take the earliest opportunity of showing to Chamberlain.

the substitution of "an Amendment Bill" for an "Amending

Mr. Parnell wrote as follows to Captain O'Shea:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="letter">
  KILMAINHAM,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>April</i> 28.<br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
I was very sorry that you had left Albert Mansions before
I reached London from Eltham, as I had wished to tell you
that after our conversation I had made up my mind that it
would be proper for me to put Mr. McCarthy in possession of
the views which I had previously communicated to you.  I
desire to impress upon you the absolute necessity of a settlement
of the arrears question which will leave no recurring
sore connected with it behind, and which will enable us to
show the smaller tenantry that they have been treated with
justice and some generosity.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The proposal you have described to me as suggested in
some quarters, of making a loan, over however many years
the payment might be spread, should be absolutely rejected,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
for reasons which I have already fully explained to you.  If
the arrears question be settled upon the lines indicated by us,
I have every confidence&mdash;a confidence shared by my colleagues&mdash;that
the exertions which we should be able to make strenuously
and unremittingly would be effective in stopping outrages
and intimidation of all kinds.
</p>

<p class="letter">
As regards permanent legislation of an ameliorative
character, I may say that the views which you always shared with
me as to the admission of leaseholders to the fair rent clauses
of the Act are more confirmed than ever.  So long as the
flower of the Irish peasantry are kept outside the Act there
cannot be any permanent settlement of the land question,
which we all so much desire.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I should also strongly hope that some compromise might
be arrived at this season with regard to the amendment of
the tenure clauses.  It is unnecessary for me to dwell upon
the enormous advantages to be derived from the full extension
of the purchase clauses, which now seem practically to have
been adopted by all parties.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The accomplishment of the programme I have sketched
would, in my judgment, be regarded by the country as a
practical settlement of the land question, and would, I feel
sure, enable us to co-operate cordially for the future with
the Liberal Party in forwarding Liberal principles; so that
the Government, at the end of the session, would, from the
state of the country, feel themselves thoroughly justified in
dispensing with further coercive measures.&mdash;Yours very truly,

<p>
I had reason to know, from various sources of information
kept open by me on Parnell's behalf during his
imprisonment, that the Government would liberate him
with considerable relief if given any surety of conciliatory
policy on his part.  Parnell at liberty was a disturbing
force, and the culminating embarrassment of English
government in Ireland, but Parnell in prison had become
merely a concentrated embarrassment in that there was
now no governmental possibility of dealing with the
reactionary spirit he had let loose in Ireland&mdash;a spirit that
was at least better controllable as a weapon in Parnell's
hand than as the scattered and absolutely irresponsible
fulminations, unreasoning and motiveless, of lawless
desperadoes.
</p>

<p>
With Parnell as her chief the Ireland he had roused
might indeed be a scourge of whips to the British
Government, but without him this Ireland was undoubtedly a
scourge of scorpions.
</p>

<p>
So Parnell came out of Kilmainham on the treaty
arranged at Eltham, and as Willie was to be the official
bearer of the olive branch to the Government, he went
over to see Parnell on his return to Kilmainham and to
get from him a letter for his own satisfaction, as he said
Parnell was "so shifty" he could not be trusted to carry
out any agreement that was not in writing, and the letter
was to set forth the various modifications of his policy of
obstruction that he would undertake to observe on his
(immediate) liberation and assurance of future concessions
to Ireland.  This letter had in substance been written at
Eltham, but Parnell had stipulated for a few days to
consider the matter further and would not give Willie his
final decision then.  On the other side he had to consider
that any treaty with the Government would place him in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
a very awkward position with the Land League and would
certainly affect the financial aid to the Irish cause so
generously contributed by America.  It was also certain,
he knew, that the Government would be obliged, in either
case, to liberate him with the other Irish political prisoners
at no distant period, and this without his placing himself
under any obligation at all to the Government.  This would
please the extreme party of his followers far better, even
though it would keep open the way to further outrage
and crime in Ireland.
</p>

<p>
I had never before ventured to influence Parnell in any
way politically; but now I greatly dreaded for him this
latter policy of the extremists and the perpetual strain of
watchfulness and control it engendered&mdash;with the Coercion
Laws such a policy must, in the long run, inevitably
produce, unless, indeed, England was prepared to yield to
force; an unthinkable proposition.
</p>

<p>
So now I threw the whole strength of my influence on
the side of the treaty of conciliation and urged upon him
the greater good for Ireland likely to accrue in the making
by him of immediate peace.  I was very anxious that he
should "reign" by constitutional means, and had every
hope of establishing such amicable communications
between him and the Government as would lead to that end.
But he had this great force now to reckon with&mdash;the force
of centuries of cruelty, wrong, and oppression that had
bred an irresponsibility and callous disregard of suffering,
nay, rather a vindictive madness and lust of destruction in
Ireland.  In his seeking for a weapon to use for the
betterment of England's government of Ireland Parnell had
discovered this underlying force of hate, and, using the
influence of his personality, he strove to direct it into the
service of the Ireland that he loved.  But he afterwards
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
stood appalled at the intensity of the passion of hate that
he had loosed, and no one but he&mdash;and I with him&mdash;knew
the awful strength of that force of destruction that was
only held in subservience by the sheer dominance of his
will.  He replied to my pleadings: "Yes, I hold them now
with my back to the wall, but if I turn to the Government
I turn my back to them&mdash;and then&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
But my great fear for him won his decision for peace,
and he wrote and signed the "letter" that Willie wanted
to take to the Government.
</p>

<p>
The Prime Minister had been prepared for its coming,
and made known that such a treaty of peace would be
acceptable.  Willie took this letter to Forster, who knew
of no understanding with the Prime Minister, and was
absolutely against any such negotiations.  He scoffed at
the letter, at its terms, and at Willie for bringing it, but
the latter pointed out that the matter was one for the
Prime Minister's consideration alone, and Mr. Forster
was bound to submit it to him without delay.  He of course
did so, but with confidence as to its rejection and, on its
immediate acceptance and the liberation of Parnell,
resigned his office as Chief Secretary for Ireland.
</p>

<p>
Lord Cowper resigned with him.  This was on the
2nd of May.  On the 26th of April discussion on
Mr. Redmond's Land Bill was started in the House of
Commons.  This Bill, which had been drafted by Parnell
in Kilmainham, proposed to amend the Land Act of 1881
in four main particulars: (1) Arrears of excessive rent;
(2) admission of leaseholders to the benefit of the Land
Court; (3) amendment of tenure clauses; (4) extension
of purchase clauses by the advance from the State of the
whole of the purchase money.  Mr. Gladstone applauded
the Irish Party and opposed the Bill.  He practically
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
admitted that recent decisions of the Irish judges were
nullifying the effect of the tenure clauses, but he did not
want yet to reopen the question.  He recognized,
however, the necessity of dealing with "Arrears."
</p>

<p>
When, on May 2nd, he announced to the House the
resignation of Lord Cowper and Mr. Forster and the
decision of the Cabinet to release the three Irish M.P.'s
who had been in Kilmainham since October, he definitely
promised an Arrears Bill, and stated that there was no
present intention to renew the Coercion Act.  So, with
this public promise of Mr. Gladstone, and with the tacit
understanding that Parnell would "slow down the agitation"
Parnell came out of gaol.  "It is an act," averred
Mr. Gladstone, "done without any negotiation, promise,
or engagement whatever."
</p>

<p>
Two days later Forster denounced the action of the
Cabinet.  He believed that the unconditioned release of
the Irish leaders would tend to the encouragement of
crime.  As he went on to justify the arrests Parnell
entered the House and took his seat.  The Irish cheered
wildly.  Then Forster continued: "The real reason why
these gentlemen were arrested ... was because they were
trying to carry out their will&mdash;'their unwritten law'
... by working the ruin and the injury of the Queen's
subjects by intimidation of one kind or another.  If
Mr. Parnell had not been placed in Kilmainham he would
very quickly have become in reality what he was called
by many of his friends&mdash;the King of Ireland."  He did
not say Parnell and his friends had directly incited, what
they had done was far more dangerous.  They had
established a system of intimidation....  They should have
been released after a public promise had been given, or
when Ireland was quiet, or fresh powers had been granted
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
to the Government.  "A surrender is bad, a compromise
or arrangement is worse....  If all England cannot
govern the Member for Cork then let us acknowledge he
is the greatest power in Ireland to-day."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gladstone, in reply, said he had no right to
humiliate Parnell by demanding a penitential confession
of guilt, and once more he disclaimed that the release was
the result of a bargain.  Parnell, following him, asserted&mdash;what
was the truth&mdash;that no mention of his release was
made by him in any written or oral communication with
his friends.
</p>

<p>
The same night, May 4th, was announced the appointment
of Lord Spencer as Lord-Lieutenant and Lord
Frederick Cavendish as Chief Secretary.  The post had
first been offered to Sir Charles Dilke, but he had refused
the offer.  It is stated that in certain quarters the name of
Mr. Chamberlain had been mentioned, and that he had
signified his willingness to accept the offer if it were made.
Apparently it was not made.  We cannot avoid speculating
what would have happened had he gone to Ireland.
He had taken a leading part in the release of Parnell;
would that have saved him&mdash;since the Phoenix Park
murderers did not intend to kill Lord Frederick?  And if
Mr. Chamberlain had been killed in May, 1882, what other
course might British politics have taken?  Would Tariff
Reform ever have been a Tory election cry?  Would there
have been no Boer War?  Would the Tories not have
enjoyed that long term of office which for years kept the
question of Home Rule in abeyance?  It were foolish to
say yes or no to any of these questions, but at least we
may say that the fact Mr. Chamberlain was not asked to
become Irish Secretary in 1882 is one of the most
momentous in British politics.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
</p>

<p>
While in Kilmainham Parnell had found it absolutely
impossible to control in any way the incitements to crime
and the wild expenditure of the Ladies' Land League.
His sister, Anna Parnell, was at the head of this marvellous
organization which she spread in well-ordered
ramifications throughout the country.  Her generalship was
magnificent and complete, and there appeared to be no
detail of this revolutionary army with which she was not
completely familiar and completely determined to control.
Parnell wrote to her again and again from prison, pointing
out the crass folly of the criminality for which the
Ladies' League, now, solely existed.  He even urged the
Governmental representations made to him for the
suppression of this league of anarchy, and the hopeless
financial position it was creating&mdash;the estimated weekly
expenditure of these ladies running into thousands of
pounds; money contributed chiefly by America for the
fighting policy of the Irish Party&mdash;but to no purpose.
</p>

<p>
The fanatic spirit in these ladies was extreme; in
Anna Parnell it was abnormal, and Parnell saw no way
of saving her, or the country, from her folly but by
fulfilling his threat of vetoing the payment of another penny
to the Ladies' Land League.  This he then did, and thus
automatically broke up this wild army of mercenaries.
Anna Parnell never forgave her brother for this act, and
to the last day of his life refused to hold any communication
with him again.  Parnell had much family affection,
and many times made overtures of peace to his sister, of
whom he was really fond, and for whose strength of mind
and will he had much respect.  On two occasions he met
her accidentally and tried to speak to her, but she resolutely
turned from him and refused any reply to the letters
he wrote her.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On Parnell's release from Kilmainham he returned to me
at Eltham, and on May 6, 1882, went to Weymouth to
welcome Michael Davitt, who came out of Portland prison
on that day.  He returned to Eltham that Saturday
evening, and the next morning, Sunday, I drove with him
to Blackheath Station, as he had to go to London to see
Davitt and others.  At the station I asked him to get me
a newspaper before he left, and waited for it in the
carriage.
</p>

<p>
From where I sat in the carriage I could see Parnell's
back as he stood just inside the station door.  I was
watching him, and he half turned and smiled at me as he opened
the paper&mdash;the <i>Sunday Observer</i>&mdash;to glance at the news
before he brought it to me.  He told me afterwards that
he wanted to see what was said about Michael Davitt.  He
had now come to the top of the steps and, as he suddenly
stopped, I noticed a curious rigidity about his arms&mdash;raised
in holding the newspaper open.  He stood so absolutely
still that I was suddenly frightened, horribly,
sickeningly afraid&mdash;of I knew not what, and, leaning forward,
called out, "King, what is it?"  Then he came down the
steps to me and, pointing to the headline, said, "Look!"
And I read, "Murder of Lord Frederick Cavendish and
Mr. Burke!"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
</p>

<p>
I heard the train coming in, and tried to pull myself
together, for the awful significance of the horrible thing
to my lover, just released from Kilmainham on the Treaty,
came home to me with a rush of pain.  His face was
ashen, and he stared, frowning heavily, before him,
unconsciously crushing the hand I had slipped into his until
the rings I wore cut and bruised my fingers.
</p>

<p>
I said to him, "Quick, you must catch this train.  See
Davitt and the others as arranged and as many more as
you can find.  Go, you will know what to do, but you
must meet them all at once."  He turned heavily away,
saying, "I shall resign," and I answered as I ran beside
him to the platform, "No, you are not a coward."
</p>

<p>
Before I left Blackheath I wired to Willie to bring
Parnell to dinner at Eltham if he could possibly manage
it, and spent one of the most terrible days of my life
considering the effect this awful crime would probably have
upon my lover's career.
</p>

<p>
Willie came down that evening, Parnell with him.
They were both very gloomy and depressed, and Parnell,
after his greeting of me&mdash;as though this were our first
meeting since he came out of prison&mdash;sat gazing stonily
before him, only glancing across at Willie with the
stormy flare in his eyes when the latter&mdash;who was really
sorry for Parnell, as well as shocked at the murders&mdash;said
something that jarred upon him.  During dinner
Willie told me of what had been done during the day, of
the absolute horror and consternation of the Irish Party,
of what Mr. Chamberlain had said on hearing of the
murders, and of Parnell's continuous threat, throughout
that awful day, of retiring from public life altogether.
</p>

<p>
Willie said to me: "I wish you would urge Parnell
not to talk so, Dick; he can't resign his seat now, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
thing's impossible; he must show that it simply does not
touch him politically in any way."
</p>

<p>
I turned to Parnell and said: "I do absolutely agree
with Willie about it, Mr. Parnell.  It would be throwing
the whole country over and a reflection upon all who joined
in that Treaty."
</p>

<p>
Parnell at last roused himself and said: "Well, I
will write to the G.O.M.[<a id="chap17fn1text"></a><a href="#chap17fn1">1</a>] and offer to resign, and abide
by his decision; the thing makes me feel hopeless of
doing any good."
</p>

<p>
On the wall of the dining-room where we sat hung a
large engraving of the "House" of 1880.  All the
members of that Parliament were in the picture, and among
them, of course, Mr. Parnell and Captain O'Shea.  As
the maid turned to leave the room, after placing the coffee
tray on a little side table, this picture, which hung
immediately behind Parnell, fell to the floor with a crash that,
in the state of nervous tension we were all in, brought us
to our feet in alarm.  Willie's chair overturned as he
jumped up; but Parnell's was steady, held in a grip that
showed his knuckles white as he held it slightly raised off
the floor, while he stood, half turned, staring at the picture
as it lay among the splintered glass.
</p>

<p>
Willie laughed, and, coming to help the parlourmaid
to pick up the picture, exclaimed: "There goes Home
Rule, Parnell!"  But he also had in him a slight dash
of the superstition that was so highly developed in
Parnell's fatalistic nature, and his smile turned to gravity as
he glanced at Parnell's tense expression and listened to
my hasty explanation of the fall: "Perhaps the wire was
rotten, or the maid had shaken the picture as she
passed!"  Parnell took the loose end of the wire in both hands and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
tried to break it.  He could not.  Willie said: "Mary
(the parlourmaid) was the other side of the room, so she
could not have shaken it."  Parnell said nothing, and we
began to speak of other things.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards I said to him: "You did not really mind
about that picture, did you?  It was only a rotten wire!"
and he answered: "It was an omen, I think, darling, but
for whom?  Willie or me?" and when I told him I
wished he would not talk such nonsense, and that I did
not believe in omens or want any falling pictures to
be "omens" for either of them, he smiled and said
no more.
</p>

<p>
The immediate consequence of the Phoenix Park
murders was the introduction of a Crimes Bill by Sir
William Harcourt on May 11th.  Parnell was not
approached on the subject.  He was given no opportunity
of criticizing the proposals and of suggesting any more
moderate measure which might have appealed to that
great body of Irish Nationalists who viewed the
murders with horror.  The new Bill went roughshod
over Irish opinion, and the conciliatory effect of the
Arrears Bill, introduced a few days later, was altogether
marred.
</p>

<p>
The second reading of the latter measure was moved
by Mr. Gladstone on May 22nd.  In the course of his
speech he said: "Eviction in the exercise of a legal right
may be to the prejudice of your neighbours, may involve
the highest reprehension, may even imply deep moral
guilt.  There may be outrages which&mdash;all things
considered, the persons and the facts&mdash;may be less guilty in
the sight of God than evictions."
</p>

<p>
The Bill was bitterly opposed by the Tory Party.
</p>

<p>
I had written to Mr. Gladstone expressing a wish that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
he should see Mr. Parnell.  He wrote in answer from
Downing Street on May 25th, 1882, declining to do so
in private, though in public he was more than ready to
co-operate with Parnell.
</p>

<p>
I suggested in reply that we should meet and talk
the matter over, and it was arranged that he should come
to see me at Thomas's Hotel on June 2nd.  He arrived
punctually at three o'clock.  We had a long talk about
Parnell and about politics&mdash;chiefly, of course, as referring
to Ireland.  He was extremely agreeable and courteous,
and I remember very well the great charm of manner he
possessed, a charm that struck me afresh at each subsequent
meeting.  A natural charm and, no doubt, a natural
insincerity, but one which is such an immense asset in
the career of a great man: that of making others believe&mdash;or
wish to believe&mdash;that they are on the same plane of
intellect and diplomacy as himself!  He was a very great
old man, I thought, as his wonderful eagle's eyes showed
just sufficient admiration in them to savour of homage
without offence.  And I may say here that, with all the
perfect courtesy of which, when he chose, he was past
master, he knew before the conclusion of our interview,
and allowed me to know that he knew, what I desired that
he should know&mdash;that my personal interest in Parnell was
my only interest in Irish politics.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gladstone having agreed that it would be of
considerable convenience to the Government to be in private
and amicable communication with Mr. Parnell, and that
I, whose interests were inseparable from those of the Irish
leader, would be confidently accepted as such intermediary
by him, we parted satisfied, I think, on both sides with the
afternoon's compact.
</p>

<p>
After this first interview with Mr. Gladstone I had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
frequently to see him at Downing Street&mdash;taking him
drafts, clauses, and various proposed amendments (of
Bills affecting Ireland) that Parnell proposed, altered, and
suggested privately to Gladstone before putting them
before the House.  Parnell, of course, always intent on
the betterment of the law as affecting Ireland; Gladstone
bargaining for the Irish vote, when without it he would
have lost his majority.
</p>

<p>
Parnell would sometimes write the rough draft of
what he wished Gladstone to know, or sometimes write
what he had to say in the form of a letter (often dating it
from my house!), but occasionally he would do neither,
as, on more than one important occasion, he said: "I
don't trust that Grand Old Spider farther than I can see
him.  Sweetheart, learn this by heart, and let it off at him
yourself."  Then I had to take down in my own handwriting
what he wished proposed to Gladstone, and at
the subsequent interview "let it off" at him.  Very often
letters were sufficient, and in this case I almost invariably
wrote them, or, if the letter was in Parnell's handwriting
addressed to me, under cover of my envelope, I would
request its return, and this was done; letters intended
for Parnell by Gladstone being invariably addressed
to me.
</p>

<p>
It was by my suggestion Mr. Gladstone opened these
private negotiations with Mr. Parnell, and I was myself
much amused to find that both these great statesmen were
of one mind as to the danger of such a trusting of one
another as such negotiations necessitated.  When I said to
Parnell, "Why not see Gladstone yourself privately, and
get what you can from him, in return for the Irish vote?"
he at once replied that such a proceeding would be fatal to
the "cause," and when I said much the same thing to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
Gladstone at our first interview&mdash;which latter was a
brilliant inspiration of Parnell's own&mdash;he replied that "such a
proceeding" would be fatal to his position, but, he added,
"it might be advantageous to the Irish leader and myself
if you, Mrs. O'Shea, would accept the thankless office of
go-between, as you suggest.  A safe and secret intermediary
might well prove to be of the greatest assistance
to us both in our efforts for the welfare of the country."  I
have wondered since which country the G.O.M. had in
his mind as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
On June 17 and 18, 1882, Gladstone wrote to me.  The
letter of the 17th was little more than a formal acknowledgment,
but in his note of the following day he referred
me to something which had passed at our last interview.
He had on that occasion directed my attention to the
proposal to amend certain severe clauses of the Crimes
Act.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Irish were fighting the Crimes Bill inch
by inch.  It had been read a second time on May 25 after
three nights' debate.  The most drastic clause, from the
legal point of view, was the suspension of the right of
trial by jury in all grave cases of agrarian crime, which
(and the Government would decide when) would be tried
by a Court of three judges, in such district as the
Attorney-general might decide.  Public meetings could be
proclaimed and newspapers suppressed.  The police were
vested with power to search private houses and arrest night
wanderers.  Finally, and against this the Irish Party
especially protested&mdash;magistrates were empowered to
convict summarily on charges of incitement, boycotting, and
membership of a secret society.
</p>

<p>
This was the iron heel with a vengeance; it took from
the Irish the last vestige of citizen right.  Parnell opposed,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
yet not violently; the remembrance of the Phoenix Park
murders held him back.  But the speeches of his followers
were bitter in the extreme.  "What profit," cried Dillon,
"can you ever expect from governing a nation which
nothing conciliates, and nothing can subdue?"  Of all
the fifty Coercion Acts passed in the eighty-eight years
since the Union this was the worst.
</p>

<p>
The second reading was carried by 383 votes against 45.
</p>

<p>
Parnell expressed a desire that Gladstone should have
his (Parnell's) views distinctly put before him by me&mdash;not
in writing.  This did not suit Gladstone.  He had no
intention of giving away his hand in regard to the Crimes
Bill, and, in the then temper of his own Party and of the
Conservatives, was not at all desirous of making any
further private concession that would certainly place him
in a too favourable light (as regards this Bill) in the eyes
of the Irishmen.
</p>

<p>
He was determined not to see me again with reference
to the Crimes Bill, and on June 23 he wrote me to that
effect.  It was obvious from the tone of his letter that he
was annoyed by the continued opposition of the Irish
Party, which, from his point of view, only served to
impede the progress of the Arrears Bill.
</p>

<p>
On one of my visits to Downing Street I told Gladstone
of the inner working of the Ladies' Land League, about
which he was curious.  I mentioned to him the enormous
sum these Lady Leaguers had expended and the great
difficulty Parnell had had in suppressing them.  When he
heard the sum of their estimated weekly expenditure a
grim smile flitted over his face.  "Very satisfactory," he
remarked, "as the ladies have evidently put these
large sums beyond the power of&mdash;of the Land League's
expenditure!"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
</p>

<p>
Gladstone would not sit still when he talked to me,
but liked to pace up and down the long room with me.
On my entry he would rise from his desk to greet me
and, solemnly handing me a chair, would walk down the
room to the door at the end, which was always open when
I entered, close it firmly and, pacing back to the door of
my entry, push it.  These preparations always made me
smile&mdash;a smile in which he joined as, coming up to me
and offering me his arm, he said: "Do you mind walking
up and down the room, I talk better so."  So we paced
up and down while I voiced Parnell's instructions and
listened to the G.O.M.'s views, intentions, and tentative
suggestions, always on my part keeping to "It is
considered that, etc.," in giving Parnell's point, and always
receiving "your friend should, etc.," or "I am prepared to
concede to your friend, etc., in return."
</p>

<p>
He was so careful in this regard that one day I said:
"What is it you shut up in that room, Mr. Gladstone,
when I come to see you?"
</p>

<p>
"Persons, or a person, you do not come to see, Mrs. O'Shea.
Only a secretary or so, and occasionally, in these
times of foolish panic, detectives.  No," in answer to my
look of inquiry, "no one can overhear a word we say
when we pace up and down like this, and, as you do not
mind it, it refreshes me."
</p>

<p>
Always as I stood face to face with this Grand Old
Man on leaving, and looked into his slate-coloured eyes,
so like those of an eagle, I experienced a sudden uneasy
feeling, in spite of his gracious courtesy, of how like to a
beautiful bird of prey this old man was: with the piercing,
cruel eyes belying the tender, courteous smile, and how,
relentless as an eagle, men like this had struck and torn
their victims.  But to me, personally, he always showed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
the marvellous charm of manner which sent me away
feeling that I was at least a compelling force in the great
game of politics and worthy of the place I held.
</p>

<p>
The political history of this time has been written many
times, and from various points of view, and in this book
I do not propose to repeat it, but only to record such point
or detail as at the time affected my King in his home life.

CHAPTER XVIII
<br />
ENVOY TO GLADSTONE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
  "<i>Good Cinna, take this paper, and look you, lay it in the<br />
  praetor's chair, where Brutus may but find it!</i>"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;SHAKESPEARE (JULIUS CÆSAR).<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Negotiations concerning the Crimes Bill were broken off,
but before the end of June, 1882, I was once more acting
as envoy to Gladstone.  The following is a characteristic
memorandum drafted by Parnell for transmission by me
to the Prime Minister:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
Although the Coercion Bill as likely to pass into law is
of such a character as to render it impossible for him to take
any further part in the Irish Land movement, yet he trusts
that the administration of the Act by the Government will
be of such a moderate character as to enable him to co-operate
generally with Mr. G. in Parliament and in the English
constituencies in carrying to a successful end that land legislation
the foundations of which were so broadly laid in the Act of last
session, and in gaining those other measures of general reform
for the benefit of the peoples of both England and Ireland
which now constitute the programme of the Liberal Party.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Since his (Parnell's) release he has taken steps to secure
that no portion of the invested surplus of the fund shall be
drawn without his signature, and he will endeavour to provide
that future remittances from the offices of the central organization
in America shall be added to this fund; the remittances
through the <i>Irish World</i>, however, he has no hopes of being
able to control in any way.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The Bill[<a id="chap18fn1text"></a><a href="#chap18fn1">1</a>] to go through all its stages in six days&mdash;Supply
to be facilitated.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
Duration to be limited to three months after assembly of
a new Parliament if present Parliament is dissolved within three
years&mdash;treason felony struck out on report.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Centres of disturbance are being rapidly created throughout
Ireland, owing to loss by tenants of legal interest in their
holdings through sale or expiry of period of redemption.  The
formation of the new Landlord Corporation accompanied by
a harsh administration of the Coercion Act will tend to
encourage landlords to resist reasonable concessions.
</p>

<p class="quote">
He has placed new clauses on the notice paper for the
Arrears Bill which will go far to meet these difficulties, and will
do what he can to facilitate Supply and the passage of that
Bill, also to prevent obstruction to other Government business.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
These notes were submitted a second time to Mr. Gladstone,
with the addition of the following paragraphs:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
This danger might be met by insertion of clauses in Arrears
Bill having compulsory retrospective effect as far back as
June, 1880, and making provision for payment of costs.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It is most desirable that Parliament should reassemble after
short holiday to make whatever permanent amendments the
Government think necessary in the Land Act.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On June 29th Mr. Gladstone wrote thanking me for my
letter and returning "the enclosure."[<a id="chap18fn2text"></a><a href="#chap18fn2">2</a>]  Reference was
made by him to the murders of Mr. Walter Bourke and
Corporal Wallace in Galway; and though I have no doubt
he did not suspect Parnell of the least shade of complicity,
it was plain that he did not completely acquit the
extremists of the <i>Irish World</i>.
</p>

<p>
The progress of the Crimes Bill was more hotly contested
than ever in the committee stage, which extended
over twenty-four sittings of the House.  Clauses were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
fought word by word, sentence by sentence.  The Bill
was read a third time on July 8th, and was passed by the
Lords four days later, receiving the Royal Assent on the
following day.  In less than a week 17 counties were
proclaimed; and by the beginning of August 170 suspects
were in custody.
</p>

<p>
On July 21st the Arrears Bill passed the Commons
by 169 to 98.  Lord Eversley (Mr. Shaw Lefevre) rightly
observes that instead of appealing to justice Mr. Gladstone
based his support of the Bill on expediency.  For years
tenants had been burdened with excessive rents on land
which their efforts had raised from prairie value.  The
wiping out of the accumulated arrears of these unjust
rents could hardly be termed a mere act of expediency.
</p>

<p>
On July 31st the Lords returned the Bill to the Commons
cut to pieces.  Certain minor concessions were made,
and the Bill was sent back otherwise in its original form.
When next it appeared in the Lords the Irish landlord
peers revolted.  The Bill promised them part payment of
what they had looked upon as a bad debt; and so&mdash;not
for the sake of justice, but for the sake of that bait of
two years' rent&mdash;they supported the Bill, which was passed
by the Lords on August 10th.  On or about August 18th,
when it became law, fifty suspects were released.
</p>

<p>
I had addressed an appeal to Mr. Gladstone against
the death sentence passed upon a young Irishman on very
doubtful evidence.  On September 14th he wrote saying
that he would certainly bring the appeal under the notice
of Lord Spencer.  I was in correspondence with
Mr. Gladstone throughout November of this year.
</p>

<p>
Ireland did not figure largely in the Parliamentary
legislation of 1883, though a number of minor Irish Bills,
on tramways, fisheries and so forth, which received the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
support of Parnell, were carried.  Parnell's position in
Ireland was impregnable, but the extremists in America
were exasperated by his constitutional agitation.  Early
in 1883 Patrick Ford started a dynamite crusade against
England in the <i>Irish World</i>, and attempts were actually
made to blow up public buildings in London, while a
nitro-glycerine factory was discovered in Birmingham.
Immediately an Explosives Bill of the most drastic
character was introduced by Sir William Harcourt and rushed
through the Commons in a single sitting.  The Irish
Party offered no opposition.
</p>

<p>
It is significant of the tactics of Mr. Gladstone that
he was secretly striving to influence the Vatican against
Home Rule.  A Mr. Errington, an Irish Catholic, but a
Whig member of Parliament, had been sent to Rome
with a letter of recommendation from Lord Granville.
Mr. Gladstone had also written about him through
Cardinal Manning, who was opposed to the mission.  His
business was at first to work for a Papal reprimand of
priests who engaged in Land League agitation.  He
succeeded finally in engineering a rescript, dated May 11th,
1883, calling upon bishops to restrain priests from taking
part in the Parnell testimonial.
</p>

<p>
Willie was very anxious that Mr. O'Hart (O'Hart's
Irish Pedigrees) should be granted a pension from the
Civil List.  Mr. Gladstone had already declined to
include him in the List of Beneficiaries.  Now at Willie's
urgent request I most reluctantly asked Mr. Gladstone
to reconsider his decision as to Mr. O'Hart, and on
September 19th, 1884, received a snub for my pains.  I
had told Gladstone that Lord Spencer was credited with
having expressed the opinion that Parnell had some
connexion with the Phoenix Park murders.  Gladstone
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
now said he was sure that Spencer did not really
believe this.
</p>

<p>
In October, 1884, Mr. Trevelyan ceased to be Irish
Secretary and entered the Cabinet as Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster.  The vacant post was offered to
Mr. Shaw Lefevre, but on hearing that Lord Spencer intended
to seek for the renewal of the Coercion Act when it expired
in September, 1885, he refused the offer.  Mr. (afterwards
Sir Henry) Campbell-Bannerman became Chief Secretary
on October 24th.
</p>

<p>
During 1884 Parnell kept quiet, and my negotiations
on his behalf with Gladstone were intermittent.
</p>

<p>
In the early part of the year, however, a document of
tremendous import was submitted&mdash;none other than "A
Proposed Constitution for Ireland," drawn up by Parnell,
which was as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
An elected Chamber with power to make enactments regarding
all the domestic concerns of Ireland, but without power to
interfere in any Imperial matter.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The Chamber to consist of three hundred members.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Two hundred and six of the number to be elected under
the present suffrage, by the present Irish constituencies, with
special arrangements for securing to the Protestant minority a
representation proportionate to their numbers; the remaining
94 members to be named in the Act constituting the Chamber.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The principle of nomination regarding this proportion of
members to last necessarily only during the duration of the
first Chamber.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The number of elected members, suffrage, and boundaries
constituencies for election of succeeding Chamber to be
capable of alteration by the preceding Chamber, excepting
those special arrangements for securing to the Protestant
minority a proportionate representation, which arrangements
shall be fixed and immutable.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The first Chamber to last for three years, unless sooner
dissolved by the Crown.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
</p>

<p class="letter">
The Chamber shall have power to enact laws and make
regulations regarding all the domestic and internal affairs of
Ireland, including her sea fisheries.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The Chamber shall also have power to raise a revenue for
any purpose over which it has jurisdiction, by direct taxation
upon property, by Customs duties, and by licences.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The Chamber shall have power to create departments for
the transaction of all business connected with the affairs over
which it has jurisdiction, and to appoint and dismiss chief and
subordinate officials for such departments, to fix the term of
their office, and to fix and pay their salaries; and to maintain
a police force for the preservation of order and the enforcement
of the law.
</p>

<p class="letter">
This power will include the constitution of Courts of Justice
and the appointment or payment of all judges, magistrates,
and other officials of such Courts, provided that the appointment
of judges and magistrates shall in each case be subject
to the assent of the Crown.
</p>

<p class="letter">
No enactment of the Chamber shall have the force of law
until it shall have received the assent of the Crown.
</p>

<p class="letter">
A sum of one million pounds sterling per annum shall be
paid by the Chamber to the Imperial Treasury in lieu of the
right of the Crown to levy taxes in Ireland for Imperial
purposes, which right would be held in suspense so long as punctual
payment was made of the above annual sum.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The right of the Imperial Parliament to legislate regarding
the domestic concerns and internal affairs of Ireland will also
be held in suspense, only to be exercised for weighty and urgent
cause.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The abolition of the office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland
and all other offices in Ireland under the Crown connected with
the domestic affairs of that country.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The representation of Ireland in the Imperial Parliament
might be retained or might be given up.  If it be retained the
Speaker might have the power of deciding what questions the
Irish members might take part in as Imperial questions, if this
limitation were thought desirable.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Such Naval and Military force as the Crown thought requisite
from time to time would be maintained in Ireland out
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
of the contribution of one million pounds per annum to the
Imperial Treasury; any excess in the cost of these forces over
such sum being provided for out of the Imperial Revenue
(i.e. by Great Britain).
</p>

<p class="letter">
The Militia would also be levied, controlled, and paid by
the Crown, and all forts, military barracks, posts, and strong
places of the country would be held and garrisoned by the
Crown forces.
</p>

<p class="letter">
No volunteer force to be raised in Ireland without the
consent of the Crown and enactment of the Imperial Parliament,
and, if raised, to be paid for and controlled by the Crown.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On May 11th, 1884, Lord Richard Grosvenor wrote a
non-committal acknowledgment of the receipt of this
memorandum.
</p>

<p>
The Government was then devoting its attention to the
Franchise Bill and the Redistribution of Seats Bill, and it
had been decided to incorporate Ireland in the scheme.
This Parnell considered to be of tremendous importance.
Speaking in December, 1883, at the Dublin banquet
held in his honour, he alluded to the force which had
then been gained for Ireland.  The change was, in
fact, enormous.  Instead of the franchise being confined
practically to the farmers, it would now include the
labourers and the cottier tenants, and the number of voters
in Ireland would go up from 200,000 to 600,000.  How
would those labourers and cottier tenants vote?  Lord
Randolph Churchill (who supported the Bill against his
Party) and Mr. Chamberlain thought, strangely enough,
that their inclusion would help the landlord interest.
Parnell knew better, and when the Bill became law, in
December, 1884, he leapt into action.  This was the
weapon for which he had been waiting.  From December
to March of the following year he went through Ireland
organizing for the imminent General Election.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
</p>

<p>
In the early months of 1885 the Liberal Government
was in a bad way.  It had narrowly escaped defeat on
the vote of censure for its failure to relieve Gordon at
Khartoum.  The Cabinet was divided against itself.
Many of the Liberal members were inclined to rebel, and
the Irish were working with the Tory Opposition.  Ireland
was the rock upon which the Government was to come to
a wreck.  The majority of the Cabinet was in favour of
continued coercion.  Mr. Chamberlain, Sir Charles Dilke,
and Mr. Shaw Lefevre were strongly opposed to it.  But
on the subject of local government for Ireland the
difference of opinion was even more dangerous.  Chamberlain
submitted a scheme for an elective National Council in
Dublin, with control over administrative Boards and
Departments, but not over the police and the administration
of the law.  It had been ascertained indirectly that
Parnell would accept this scheme, and would not oppose
a moderate Coercion Act.  Gladstone was prepared to go
a step further and give the National Council control over
the police.  A vote was taken in the Cabinet.  All the
Peers, with the exception of Lord Granville,[<a id="chap18fn3text"></a><a href="#chap18fn3">3</a>] were
against, and the Commoners, with the exception of Lord
Hartington, were in favour of the scheme.  Therefore
"for the present" the scheme was abandoned.  This
was in May.  The battle over coercion remained to be
fought.  In less than four weeks the Government was
out of office.
</p>

<p>
Gladstone had not been able to make up his mind to
abandon coercion altogether, though he had endeavoured
to sweeten the draught with the promise of a Land Purchase
Bill, and Parnell had been able to arrange privately
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
with the Conservative Opposition that if they came into
power coercion would be dropped.
</p>

<p>
On June 8th the Government was beaten on the second
reading of the Budget.  The ostensible question, which
concerned nobody, was that of a tax on wine and beer.
The whole of the thirty-nine Irish members voted for the
Opposition, and the Government was beaten by twelve.
Thereupon Gladstone resigned and Lord Salisbury formed
his first Ministry.  Parnell held the key of the position.
He had put the Tories into power; at his will he could
put them out again.
</p>

<p>
Lord Carnarvon became Lord Lieutenant, Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach Chief Secretary, and the intention was
expressed to govern Ireland by constitutional methods.
Coercion for the time being was abandoned, Lord
Carnarvon had thought much on Irish questions, and his
rule was in marked contrast to that of his immediate
predecessors.
</p>

<p>
On July 14th Lord Richard Grosvenor suddenly
remembered Parnell's draft Constitution for Ireland which
I had submitted to Gladstone.  Did it still hold good?
To this letter I replied, and on July 23rd Lord Richard
wrote again asking for a plain answer.  But this at the
moment it was impossible to give, for the attitude the
Tories would take up with regard to Home Rule was not
yet certain.  Lord Carnarvon, the Lord Lieutenant, was
believed to be very favourably disposed to the Irish
demands, and Lord Randolph Churchill seemed willing
to go far.  On July 28th Lord Richard wrote again,
imploring us to show our hand.  Evidently the Irish vote
was worth securing.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that on July 17th Mr. Chamberlain,
speaking at Holloway, urged that the pacification
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
of Ireland depended on the concession to her of the right
to govern herself in the matter of purely local business.
</p>

<p>
At the end of July Parnell met Lord Carnarvon in
London.  The Lord Lieutenant had already been in
communication with Sir Charles Gavan Duffy and Mr. Justin
McCarthy upon the subject of Home Rule, and there can
be little doubt he was in earnest in his agreement with the
principle.  How far he was used by his Party as a
cat's-paw to play for the Irish vote is another question.  At
least Lord Salisbury knew of the proceedings of his
colleague and was perhaps not averse from using Lord
Carnarvon's convictions to win Parnell's support at the
forthcoming elections without giving a definite Party pledge.
The conversation between Lord Carnarvon and Parnell
led the latter to believe that the Tories were prepared to
support a measure of local government for Ireland.  But
how far were the Liberals prepared to go?
</p>

<p>
On August 4th Mr. Gladstone wrote to me further
with reference to the proposed constitution for Ireland.
Did this represent Parnell's views now?  He was urgent
in asking for an answer.  In one of my notes I had spoken
of the suggestion that a proposition of his son,
Mr. Herbert (now Lord) Gladstone, should be substituted
for it.  Mr. Gladstone now assured me on the best
authority that no such proposition had been made.
I gathered, however, that his son had made some
suggestions.
</p>

<p>
To this a long and comprehensive reply was
sent&mdash;apparently too long and comprehensive.  No doubt he
wanted a definite and limited scheme to be set before him.
I had referred in my letter to certain changes which had
occurred since the draft was sent.  I knew that Gladstone
knew what those changes were, for the frantic appeals for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
a definite statement were precisely the counter-bidding
against the heightened biddings of Lord Randolph
Churchill and the Conservative Party in which Gladstone
declared he would not engage.  He was obviously
disinclined to make an offer until Parnell had pinned himself
down to a final demand.  If only he could know what the
Home Rule Party wanted!
</p>

<p>
The following day Mr. Gladstone set out on a yachting
expedition (to Norway), and a few days later, on
August 11th, Parliament was prorogued.
</p>

<p>
Parnell opened his campaign in Dublin on August
11th, when he announced that he and his Party would
stand for an Irish Parliament and nothing else.  There
was no talk now of a National Council.  Lord Hartington
replied declaring Parnell's proposals to be fatal and
mischievous, and on September 9th Lord Richard wrote,
on behalf of Mr. Gladstone, who was back in England,
pleading for details.
</p>

<p>
On October 7th Lord Salisbury, speaking at Newport
(Mon.), made a diplomatic statement about Ireland which
suggested much and promised nothing.
</p>

<p>
Later in the month I sent Mr. Gladstone a paper
containing the views of Mr. Parnell, and on November 3rd
Lord Richard Grosvenor replied, referring me to the
Government of the day, but thanking me for the
information.  There was some mention in the letter of
Willie's prospects for Mid-Armagh.  Apparently that
affair was off, since Willie had himself written to such an
effect.  Willie was given a gentle rap on the fingers for
having in Ireland talked over the plans for his election
with another person.[<a id="chap18fn4text"></a><a href="#chap18fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
</p>

<p>
On November 9th, at Edinburgh, Mr. Gladstone made
a speech which rivalled Lord Salisbury's in elusiveness.
The constitutional demands of Ireland must not be
disregarded, but it would be a vital danger if at such a time
there was not a Party politically independent of the Irish
vote.
</p>

<p>
Parnell desired precisely the contrary, and on November
21st, the eve of the General Election, a manifesto was
issued calling upon Irish voters in Great Britain to vote
against the Liberal Party.
</p>

<p>
Before Parnell's interview with Lord Carnarvon I had
sent Gladstone Parnell's suggestions for a new Home
Rule Bill.  Mr. Gladstone wrote expressing satisfaction
at the news of the intended interview, but he would not
be drawn.  Nevertheless Parnell made another attempt,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
and on December 14th, 1885, addressed the following letter
from my house at Eltham:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
  NORTH PARK, ELTHAM, KENT.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>December</i> 14th, 1885.<br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
MY DEAR MRS. O'SHEA,&mdash;It appeared to me from Mr. Gladstone's
utterances in Scotland that he would admit the
justice of Ireland's claim for autonomy, and also the expediency
of soon endeavouring to satisfy it provided the result of
the General Election went to show an overwhelming
preponderance of the opinion of the representatives of Ireland
in favour of this claim.  A very proper reservation was also
made regarding the maintenance of the supremacy of the
Crown in Ireland and all the authority of Parliament necessary
for this supremacy.
</p>

<p class="letter">
We now know that more than five-sixths of the Irish members
elected by household suffrage have been returned, mostly
by very large majorities, as supporters of the institution of an
Irish Parliament, that a clear majority, seventeen out of
thirty-three, from the Ulster constituencies have been so returned,
and that only one county and one city in Ireland, Antrim and
Belfast respectively, are without Nationalist representation.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Under these circumstances does it not seem that the question
has now resolved itself firstly into a consideration of
the details of the proposed settlement, and secondly, as to the
procedure to be adopted in obtaining the assent of Parliament,
and if needful of the British electorate to this settlement?
As regards the first matter, the rough sketch, which I sent
you some weeks back, appeared then, and still appears to me,
the smallest proposal which would be likely to find favour in
Ireland if brought forward by an English Minister, but it is
not one which I could undertake to suggest publicly myself,
though if it were enacted I would work in Ireland to have it
accepted bona fide as a final settlement, and I believe it would
prove to be one.

<br />
FACSIMILE OF A PORTION OF LETTER ON pp. 190, 192-3.
</p>

<p class="letter">
This proposal was carefully designed with a view to
propitiate English prejudice, and to afford those guarantees
against hasty legislation, interference in extraneous matters,
and unfair action against particular classes, apprehended by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
many persons as a result of the establishment of an Irish
Parliament.  It did not involve a repeal of the Act of Union,
an irrevocable step, and the Imperial Parliament having conferred
the privilege by statute would thus always be in a position
to recall it by a similar method, if the privilege was abused.
</p>

<p class="letter">
It provided for a special proportionate representation for
the large Protestant minority of Ireland.  It also left to the
Imperial Parliament the practical decision from time to time
as to the matters which did or did not come within the
province of the local legislature.  These are all important
concessions and guarantees, and some opinion must surely have
been formed by now upon these and other details.
</p>

<p class="letter">
As regards the question of procedure, I am desirous of
knowing after a time whether the solution of the Irish
question would be made the first and only business by a Liberal
Government till the question was settled.  The reform of
procedure would probably be found not so necessary or pressing
if the Imperial Parliament could get rid of its Irish work.
It appeared to me that the best way to turn out the present
Government would be by a general vote of censure without
special reference to Ireland, or by a vote directed against some
act of policy other than Irish, for which occasion may shortly
arise.  We might then either abstain or vote for the censure as
might be deemed best.  I have not seen Lord C.,[<a id="chap18fn5text"></a><a href="#chap18fn5">5</a>] and shall
probably not arrange to do so for a week or two, as I wish to
know how the other side is disposed first.  I have always felt
Mr. Gladstone is the only living statesman who has both the
power and the will to carry a settlement it would be possible
for me to accept and work with.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I doubt Lord C.'s power to do so, though I know him to
be very well disposed.  However, if neither party can offer
a solution of the question I should prefer the Conservatives
to remain in office, as under them we could at least work out
gradually a solution of the Land question.  You will see from
this letter that I am very much in the dark, except as to my
own mind and that of Ireland, that I want information as to
whether Mr. Gladstone has, as I suppose, accepted the principle
of a Chamber for Ireland with power over her domestic and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
internal affairs, and, if so, which, if any, of the details
contained in sketch he objects to or is in doubt about.  Further,
it is important that I should be advised before the meeting of
Parliament what procedure would in his judgment be best for
bringing about that change of Government which would enable
Mr. Gladstone to deal authoritatively with the Irish
question.&mdash;Yours very truly, CHAS. S. PARNELL.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I sent this letter to Gladstone, and on December 16,
three days before the completion of the General Election,
he dispatched from Hawarden a long reply; but he said
nothing more than he had already said in public at
Midlothian and elsewhere and in private letters to me.
Throughout this period the one fact apparent was that
he would pledge the Liberal Party to nothing until he
was in office and supported by the Irish Party.  While
there was a Tory Government in alliance with Parnell he
would do nothing.  Whether or no he was sincere in his
advice to us to take Home Rule rather from the Tories
than the Liberals if possible&mdash;because many Liberals would
support a Tory Home Rule Bill, while all Tories would
oppose a Liberal measure&mdash;this I cannot say.  He offered
it constantly, though he urged that a trafficking with both
Parties for the purpose of getting the best terms possible,
when, as in the end it must be, avowed, would injure
a Tory measure and kill a Liberal one.
</p>

<p>
The result of the election was that the Tories in alliance
with the Parnellites outnumbered the Liberals by four.
The Liberals in alliance with Parnell would have
outnumbered the Tories by 167.  Parnell had swept the board
in Ireland, and in the House of Commons he was dictator.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after the General Election the Salisbury
Cabinet met to consider its Irish policy, and Lord
Carnarvon at once tendered his resignation.  The conclusion
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
to be drawn is obvious.  Compact or no compact, Lord
Carnarvon had reason to believe that the Cabinet were
prepared to pursue a certain line of policy which it now
appeared they had no intention of pursuing.  The reason
for the <i>volte face</i>, too, is plain.  Tories plus Parnellites
formed too narrow a majority of the House for Governmental
purposes.  The Irish were no longer of any use,
and they were abandoned.
</p>

<p>
Correspondence with Mr. Gladstone continued, and
his letters were still cautious.  He seemed to fear the
soreness of certain Liberals over the Parnellite opposition at
the polls, but he confessed to be very willing to co-operate
with the Tory Government in the matter of Home Rule,
and he stated that he had acquainted the Government with
his disposition.  Letters of December 19th, 22nd, and 24th
are all more or less to this effect.  He harped on the word
"bribe."
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, Mr. Gladstone had approached the
Cabinet through Mr. Balfour, both personally and by
letter, urging that it would be a calamity if this great
question were to fall into the lines of Party conflict.  The
Cabinet seem to have treated Mr. Gladstone's letter with
scant respect.  In spite of Lord Carnarvon's tendered
resignation, Lord Salisbury was resolved to make no
concession to Home Rule.  Lord Carnarvon agreed not to
resign until the opening of Parliament.
</p>

<p>
A statement in the Press inspired by Mr. Herbert
Gladstone to the effect that Mr. Gladstone was prepared
to concede an Irish Parliament in Dublin was declared by
the latter to be "inaccurate and not authentic."  But on
December 26 he issued a memorandum to certain of his
more reliable followers to the effect that he would support
the Tories in a Home Rule policy which should satisfy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
him and the Irish Nationalists, and that if he were called
upon to form a Government the preparation of a scheme
of duly guarded Home Rule would be an indispensable
condition.
</p>

<p>
On December 29 I wrote to Gladstone, forwarding a
memorandum from Parnell.  On the last day of the year
he sent me a memorandum marked "Secret," in which he
summarized the position between Parnell and himself.  It
amounted to this: Parnell wanted a definite pledge that
there should be no more coercion before throwing the
Tories out of power and putting the Liberals in.  Gladstone,
while realizing the gravity of O'Brien's statistics
in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> as to the result of exceptional
legislation, refused to give this pledge.  He alluded
philosophically to the probable course of events if the Address
went through unamended.  Mr. Parnell wrote to me to
the following effect embodying the points I was to pass on
to Gladstone.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
DEAR MRS. O'SHEA,&mdash;In reply to your query it would be
inexpedient that the Government....  But, in any case,
we should move a series of separate amendments to the
Address&mdash;one asking for a suspension of the support by the naval,
military and constabulary forces of the Crown of ejectments,
pending the consideration by Parliament of the proposed Land
measure; another praying the Crown to remove Chief Justice
May from the Bench; a third condemning the practice of jury
packing, resorted to by the Crown in all the recent trials; a
fourth asking her Majesty to fulfil the promise contained in
the Speech of last year for the equalization of the borough
franchise in Ireland to that in England; a fifth condemning the
proclamation of the meetings at Brookeboro' and Cullohill; and
a sixth protesting against the proclamation and additional police
force sent to several of the counties.
</p>

<p class="letter">
This would be an assault along the whole line of English
misgovernment in Ireland, and should, in my opinion, be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
delivered before we allow the Address to leave the House.  The
first fortnight or so of the session would thus be occupied
while the Government were making up their minds as to their
proposed Land Bill.
</p>

<p class="letter">
At the meeting of the Party I think of proposing a resolution
recommending the minority to pay more deference to the
opinion of the majority than they did last session, and urging
all the Irish members to sit together in opposition.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Kindly let me know what you think of these proposals.&mdash;Yours
truly, CHARLES S. PARNELL.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
These blanks were left in the letter as the phrases
omitted were too confidential to be written.  I learnt them
and quoted them to Gladstone.
</p>

<p>
On January 21 Parliament met to transact business,
and the resignations of Lord Carnarvon and Sir W. Hart
Dyke were announced.  Notice was given of a new
Coercion Act, and on the 26th the Government was
defeated by 331 to 252 votes&mdash;not, however, on an Irish
amendment, but on the motion of Jesse Collings raising
the question of "three acres and a cow."

[<a href="#chap18fn4text">4</a>] Captain O'Shea had made himself unpopular with the Irish Party,
and when in 1885 he wanted their co-operation in his re-election for
County Clare, only Parnell was ready to help him.  He had always
refused to sit with the Party, had taken a place on the Government
benches, and thence kept up a running fire of sarcastic comment on the
speeches and mannerisms of his fellow-countrymen.  His intimacy with
Chamberlain was also a cause of suspicion, and he would not take the
Party pledge.  Mrs. O'Shea was anxious for him to remain in Parliament,
as his political interests left him little time for visiting Eltham.  The
need for watchful diplomacy when he was there was irksome to her.
Especially since the February of 1882 she could not bear to be near him.
Parnell had great doubt of the possibility of getting Captain O'Shea
returned for Clare or any other Irish seat without the pledge.  O'Shea,
under the impression that he himself had been the chief negotiator of
the "Kilmainham Treaty," accused Parnell of ingratitude and treachery.
Mrs. O'Shea then got into touch with Lord Richard Grosvenor, and a
scheme was put on foot for getting Captain O'Shea nominated for the
Exchange Division of Liverpool as a Liberal.  The united strength of
the Liberal Party, exercised by Lord Richard Grosvenor and through him
by Mr. Gladstone, and of Parnell's influence on the Irish vote, failed to
carry him in.  The retirement of the English Liberal candidate,
Mr. T. E. Stephens, even after nomination
and the concentration of the Liberal
forces on O'Shea's election did not suffice.  Mr. L. R. Baily, the
Conservative, defeated him by 55 votes.  Captain O'Shea then returned to
the demand for an Irish seat, and persisted in being nominated at the
by-election pending in Galway.  He still refused to take the Party pledge.
Parnell, therefore, at first refused to countenance his candidature, but
finally gave way, and he was elected.

THE FIRST HOME RULE BILL

<p class="poem">
  "<i>Memories, images and precious thoughts<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;WORDSWORTH.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Before forming his Cabinet Mr. Gladstone enunciated
the necessity for an examination whether it was practicable
to establish a legislative body to sit in Dublin, and to deal
with Irish, as distinguished from Imperial affairs.
</p>

<p>
Five of the members of his last Cabinet&mdash;Lords Hartington,
Derby, Northbrook, Selborne and Carlingford&mdash;signified
their absolute opposition to Home Rule.
Two&mdash;Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Trevelyan&mdash;agreed to the
inquiry provisionally.  Two&mdash;Sir Charles Dilke and
Mr. Shaw Lefevre&mdash;had been defeated at the General Election.
Seven&mdash;Lords Granville, Spencer, Kimberley, Ripon and
Rosebery, Sir William Harcourt and Mr. Childers&mdash;agreed
absolutely.  Four new men&mdash;Mr. Morley,
Mr. Campbell-Bannerman, Mr. Mundella and Lord Herschell&mdash;came
into the Cabinet.  Mr. Morley became Irish Secretary.
A scheme was drafted by Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Morley.
It consisted of two Bills, a Home Rule Bill and
a Land Bill.  On the scheme being laid before the Cabinet
Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Trevelyan resigned.[<a id="chap19fn1text"></a><a href="#chap19fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
</p>

<p>
On April 8th, 1886, the evening of the introduction of
the Home Rule Bill, Mr. Gladstone sent his private
secretary down to Eltham with a letter to me asking me
to telegraph one word, "Yes," if he was to introduce the
Bill that night.  In this case he was to speak shortly after
four o'clock.  Mr. Parnell had not given him the required
answer earlier, as he had up to the last moment been
trying to induce Mr. Gladstone to give the Bill wider and
more comprehensive clauses than the G.O.M. would assent
to.  Now, however, he had said to me, as he started that
evening for the House: "This Bill will do as a beginning;
they shall have more presently.  If the Old Man
wires to know if it is all right answer 'Yes.'"  Mr. Gladstone
had previously arranged with me that I should be
at home waiting for his message in order that I might let
him know that Parnell and the "Party" were ready.
</p>

<p>
His messenger was so late that I simply snatched
Gladstone's letter from him and, scribbling my "Yes" on
the enclosed Government form, sent my waiting servant
flying to the telegraph office with it.  After which I had
time to join in the regrets of Mr. Gladstone's secretary
that his master had made it impossible for me to get up
to the House in time for his introduction of the Bill.
The secretary told me that he would have "derived
considerable interest" from the proceedings, but I felt much
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
more keenly than that about this Bill that I had taken so
often in its swaddling clothes from parent to foster parent,
and I was very much disappointed at not being present at
its introduction to a larger life.
</p>

<p>
The debate on the first and second readings lasted
sixteen days.  It is to be remembered that in his attack
on the Bill Mr. Chamberlain did not oppose Home Rule,
but only this particular scheme.
</p>

<p>
A great wish of Willie's was to be appointed Under-secretary
for Ireland.  I had on various occasions made
the suggestion to Mr. Gladstone, but without successful
issue.  Gladstone had a perfect manner of refusing
appointments when personally asked for them; it was always
an apparent pain to him; nothing but the knowledge of
his duty restrained him from interference, and though I
was not really anxious that Willie should receive this
appointment I was willing to please him by asking for it,
and it might have excited suspicion if I had not asked.
I must admit that Mr. Gladstone never to my knowledge
of him all those years made an appointment from motives
of private favour.  Here once more, when he wrote
regretting he couldn't poach on his colleagues' patronage
preserves, his manners were perfect.
</p>

<p>
On May 8th an urgent letter from Gladstone at Downing
Street was delivered at my house.  Mr. Morley had
lost track of Mr. Parnell, and wanted to know where he
was.  It was apparently the most natural thing in the
world to ask me where was Parnell.  A form of Government
telegram was enclosed for my reply.
</p>

<p>
In view of the fact that Mr. Gladstone and his colleagues
were so pained, surprised, and properly shocked
when Mr. Parnell was publicly arraigned as my lover, the
frantic way in which they applied to me, when they were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
unable to find him, was, afterwards, a source of
considerable amusement to us both.
</p>

<p>
From the time of my first interview with Mr. Gladstone
onwards, no time was lost in "failing to trace him here"
before hurried application was made to me at my&mdash;and
Parnell's&mdash;permanent address.  I did not choose that the
Irish Party should have his private address&mdash;nor did
Parnell choose it&mdash;but I was most particular that the
Government should know it.  Governments&mdash;especially
Liberal Governments&mdash;are before all things simple-minded
and of childlike guilelessness.
</p>

<p>
I remember when on one occasion the Government
desired to know Parnell's views on certain matters before
elaborating a Bill shortly to go before the House, a special
messenger was sent to Eltham with a letter.  I had gone
to the seaside with my children, and my servants had
standing orders that they knew nothing of Mr. Parnell or
of his whereabouts.  So the nonplussed Governmental
messenger meditated upon my doorstep for one moment
only, then, armed with "<i>Mrs. O'Shea's address</i>" at
Hastings, came straight on to receive Mr. Parnell's reply,
and safely deliver it within the stipulated time.  But there
can be no doubt, of course, that Mr. Gladstone's "Poor
fellow, poor fellow, what a terrible fall," subsequent to
the hounding, at his word, of his gallant opponent to death
by the Irish sycophants, alluded to the breaking of the
eleventh commandment of social life: "Thou shalt not
be found out" (publicly), rather than to the seventh of
orthodox Christianity.
</p>

<p>
On June 7th Mr. Parnell spoke on the Home Rule
Bill.  It was the last night of the debate, and he had
carefully prepared his speech.
</p>

<p>
The rejection of the Bill by a full House&mdash;343 against
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
313 votes&mdash;was immediately followed by the dissolution of
Parliament.  Thus in July, 1886, the Liberals went out
in alliance with the Irish leader, whom, only twelve months
before, they had gone out <i>denouncing</i> with all his
followers.
</p>

<p>
So ends the most important period of my negotiations
with Gladstone.  The subsequent course of them may
be sketched briefly.
</p>

<p>
In July, 1886, Gladstone replied to certain suggestions
of Parnell recommending perseverance with the Home
Rule scheme, with the objection that he was unable to
carry the Gladstonian Party beyond a certain point.
</p>

<p>
There were times when Mr. Gladstone became somewhat
uneasy in regard to the possible consequences of
so many interviews with me.  Also someone said once to
him, "Supposing Mrs. O'Shea told Parnell you said so
and so, and it was more than you meant to say?"  On
June 15th, 1887, for example, he wrote asking with utmost
politeness for a letter instead of an interview.
</p>

<p>
However, on August 22nd of the same year I find him
writing from Hawarden thanking me for some gift (of
game or fruit) and expressing hope of the future.
</p>

<p>
Gladstone now told me that he wished to meet Parnell
in order to talk over the political situation, and I
suggested that a visit to Hawarden by Parnell would have
a good effect politically.  Gladstone then asked Parnell
to Hawarden to discuss the outlook in politics, an
invitation which Parnell did not answer at once, as he first
wished to ascertain the tactics of the Conservative Party.
</p>

<p>
On August 30th, 1889, Mr. Gladstone wrote to Parnell
a most private letter, lamenting that he had not heard
from him and his friends with reference to a visit to
Hawarden.  The fact was that since Parnell had received
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
Gladstone's invitation the Tories had been making
advances, and had just proffered a Roman Catholic
University for Ireland.  Gladstone was right in supposing that
here was the cause of Parnell's silence.  He was not
angry, but he threatened Parnell with the effect of this
new proposal on Nonconformist and Presbyterian Liberals.
</p>

<p>
In October the air was clearer, the Government's Irish
University scheme had gone awry, and Gladstone was
jubilant.  He wrote on the 16th renewing the invitation.
With regard to the Home Rule Bill he was all for reserve;
with regard to Parnell's action against the <i>Times</i> all for
dispatch.
</p>

<p>
It was two months later, however (on December 19th),
that Parnell, on his way to Liverpool, visited Gladstone
at Hawarden.  It was a short but agreeable visit, and at
dinner Mr. Parnell sat next to Miss Gladstone.  The
conversation turned upon actors and acting, and Miss
Gladstone said, "Who is the greatest actor you have ever
seen, Mr. Parnell?"  "Your father, undoubtedly!" he
promptly returned, much to her delight.
</p>

<p>
As Parnell became moderate in politics Gladstone
became more extreme.  I remember one evening in April
or May, 1888, driving with Parnell to Morley's house in
Elm Park Gardens where Parnell and Morley had a quiet
conversation together.
</p>

<p>
I waited in the hansom cab a little way off the house
for a considerable time, and at last Parnell came out with
an amused expression on his face.  As we were driving
home he said:
</p>

<p>
"We can never satisfy English politicians!  They
imprisoned me for causing agitation in Ireland, and now
they want agitation, if not outrage.  Morley said to me:
'The people must be made to wake up a bit; can't you
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
do anything to stir them up?'"  Then with a laugh:
"If they knew how easy it was for me to stir Ireland up,
and how confoundedly difficult I have found it to quiet
her down again, they would be very careful before giving
me such an invitation!"  And, with the experience of
the past to give force and conviction to his words, he had
shown Mr. Morley the extreme danger of Mr. Gladstone's
suggestions.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap19fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap19fn1text">1</a>] The letters of Captain O'Shea preserved by Mrs. Parnell throw
some light on Mr. Chamberlain's mind.  In December, 1884, Chamberlain
dealt at length with the Nationalist movement and the sentiment behind
it, and unfolded his plan for a "National Board" for Ireland.  In March,
1885, he was discussing the possibility of an arrangement with the Irish
Party to get the Redistribution Bill and the Crimes Bill quickly into law
on condition that the Government brought in Local Government Bills,
including one for Ireland.  In May, Captain O'Shea wrote that Gladstone
was strongly in favour of this solution, and that, to Chamberlain's
surprise, Lord Hartington did not
reject the proposal off-hand, as expected.
He added that the Cardinal had power to assure Parnell and the Government
of the full support of the Catholic Church.  Captain O'Shea's personal
interest in the abortive scheme is revealed in the following passage
from a letter of May 4, 1885: "The reason I am anxious about the
Local Self-Government scheme is that if Chamberlain has power, which
I think he will in the next Parliament, he will offer me the Chief
Secretaryship, or the equivalent post if the name is abolished, if the
boys will let me have it."

CHAPTER XX
<br />
MR. PARNELL IN DANGER&mdash;FOUNDING OF THE NATIONAL LEAGUE
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>He who for winds and clouds<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maketh a pathway free,<br />
  Through waste or hostile crowds<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can make a way for thee.</i>"<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
One morning in 1882 I saw in the morning papers a
cable message announcing the death of Miss Fanny
Parnell.  Mr. Parnell was at my house at the time, but
asleep.  After an all-night sitting I would never allow
him to be roused until four in the afternoon, when he
would have breakfast and chat with me until it was time
to go to the House.  On seeing the newspaper cable from
America about his sister I thought it better to wake him and
tell him of it, lest he should read it while I was away with
my aunt.  I knew that Fanny Parnell was his favourite
sister, and he had told me that she was the cleverest and
most beautiful woman in his family.  This I knew was
high praise, as Willie had met Mrs. Thomson&mdash;another
of Parnell's sisters&mdash;and had told me that she was the most
strikingly beautiful woman he had ever met.
</p>

<p>
I woke him and told him of his sister's death as gently
as I could, but he was terribly shocked, and I could not
leave him at all that day.  For a time he utterly broke
down, but presently a cable arrived for him&mdash;sent on from
London&mdash;saying that his sister's body was to be embalmed
and brought to Ireland, and his horror and indignation
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
were extreme.  He immediately wrote out a message for
me to cable from London on his behalf, absolutely
forbidding the embalmment of his sister's body, and saying
that she was to be buried in America.
</p>

<p>
The idea of death was at all times very painful to him,
but that anyone should be embalmed and taken from one
place to another after death was to him unspeakably awful.
For this, amongst other reasons, I could not bear to have
him taken to Ireland&mdash;to Glasnevin Cemetery&mdash;after his
death.  My desire was to have him near me and, as he
would have wished, to have taken care of his grave
myself.  But I gave way to the longing of the Ireland he
had lived for, and to the clamour of those who had helped
to kill him.  How they dealt with him alive is history
now, but how they dealt with him in death is not so
well known; and I give an extract from the message of
a friend, who had gone to see his grave a few short years
after his death: "Your husband's grave is the most
desolate and neglected spot in the whole cemetery, and I
grieve to tell you of the painful impression it made upon
me."
</p>

<p>
I then sent over a servant, with some flowers, and his
report was even worse.  Fragments of glass from the
broken artificial wreaths, placed there years before;
trampled, neglected grass, and little of that but weeds;
and the bare untidy backings and wires of the wreaths I
had been sending for the greeting of so many days marked
only in the calendar of our love.
</p>

<p>
Poor Ireland&mdash;a child in her asking, a child in her
receiving, and so much a child in her forgetting.
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Parnell first came to Eltham he told me
that he had had, since his boyhood at school, a habit of
sleep-walking whenever he was at all run down in health.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
When he was in America he used to lock the door of his
room and put the key into a box with a spring lock that
he had bought for the purpose.  He feared he might
wander about the hotel in his sleep.  Also he warned me,
when he first came, that he was subject to "night terrors,"
very much as a highly strung child is, and in these he
would spring up panic-stricken out of deep sleep, and,
without fully awaking, try to beat off the imaginary foe
that pressed upon him.  It was a species of nightmare;
not apparently excited by any particular cause other than
general want of tone.  After a few years of careful dieting
I succeeded in freeing him of these painful and most
wearing attacks.
</p>

<p>
When the attacks came on I went into his room and
held him until he became fully conscious, for I feared that
he would hurt himself.  They were followed by a profuse
perspiration and deep sleep of several hours.  He was
terribly worried about these nightmares, but I assured him
that it was only indigestion in a peculiar form.  "You
really think so?" he would reply, and when I told him
that they would pass off with careful dieting he was
reassured, and he followed my directions so implicitly as
to diet that he soon proved me right.
</p>

<p>
He became very much run down again after his sister's
death, but recovered perfectly, and had no recurrence of
these attacks until some years after, when he suffered from
a nervous breakdown brought on by overwork.  Sir Henry
Thompson treated him then, and he quickly recovered.
</p>

<p>
Soon after I met Mr. Parnell I sent to Worcester for
some white roses in pots to keep in my hothouse in order
to provide my exigeant lover with buttonholes.  He loved
white roses, he told me, and would not be content with
any other flower from me; nor would he wear a rose from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
my garden, as he said anyone could have those who asked
me for them.  So I had to keep a constantly blooming
company of white roses in my conservatory to provide a
buttonhole of ceremony on his speech days, or on other
occasions when I wished him to look particularly well.
Sometimes we would drive out miles into the country.
Keston Common was a favourite resort of ours, and, as
we rarely took a servant with us, we would either put up
the horse I drove (Dictator, given to me by Mr. Parnell)
at some inn, or tie him to a tree while we wandered about
or sat under the trees talking.
</p>

<p>
He would do his best to learn the names of the wild
flowers he picked for me&mdash;with uncomfortably short
stalks!&mdash;but, beyond being at last able to name a dandelion or
buttercup at sight, he did not shine in any branch of
botany.  "What did you call this fine plant?" he would
ask with a glimmer of fun in his eyes.  "It is not a plant
you have, but a single flower branch, and it is called a
king-cup&mdash;picked much too short!" I would answer
severely, and he laughed as he tumbled his trophies into
my lap and insisted that the ferns ruthlessly dug and cut
out with his pocket-knife would grow all right, in spite
of their denuded roots, if I "made them do it, in the
greenhouse!"
</p>

<p>
When it was too wet to go out, or if he was not well,
he used to amuse himself at home in my sitting-room
practising shooting with an air-gun.  He used a lighted
candle for target, and became so expert in putting out
the light this way that it became too troublesome to
light the candle so often, and we substituted other
targets.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes he would go to the farther end of my aunt's
park, where there was a pond basin, dried up long before,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
and many happy hours were spent there, shooting in turn,
with his revolvers.
</p>

<p>
I remember on one Sunday afternoon my aunt's bailiff
came down, having heard revolver shots, though the sound
was deadened by the high banks.  The bailiff was much
perturbed by our Sunday sport, chiefly because it was
Sunday.  He did not dare press his opinion upon me, as
he knew my position in my aunt's household was
impregnable, but he had always been jealous of my coming to
Eltham, where he had served her for over forty years,
and he was now so plainly antagonistic that Mr. Parnell,
who did not particularly wish his presence with me talked
about, rose to the occasion with the tact he could exert
when he considered it worth while.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is that you, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;?" rising from an absorbed
examination of his last bull's-eye.  "Mrs. O'Shea was
telling me when we started this match of your being such
a good shot with a gun.  Do have a shot with my revolver;
see here, I've got a bull's-eye five times running against
Mrs. O'Shea's one.  Now let us see what you can do."
</p>

<p>
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; hesitated; he was a fine shot and had won
prizes in his youth, and was susceptible to flattery.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Parnell said dryly: "I don't suppose you have
had so much practice as I lately, but&mdash;"  The bailiff
turned a wary eye on his wife, who was waiting for him
at the gate of a rookery some way off, and Mr. Parnell
smiled as he said: "The lady will not see you," in such a
gently sarcastic manner that Mr. &mdash;&mdash; was nettled, and
picking up the revolver shot so wildly that he missed the
little target altogether.
</p>

<p>
I said: "Mr. &mdash;&mdash; <i>can</i> shoot, really, Mr. Parnell,
as I told you, but he is nervous!" So Mr. &mdash;&mdash; went
on, making shot after shot with varying success till
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; appeared on the scene dressed in her best and Sunday
virtue, which was resplendent in Eltham.  She gazed with
pain upon Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, who, to appear at ease, entered into
a discussion of revolver patterns with Mr. Parnell.  I
talked cheerfully to her for a few moments, and introduced
Mr. Parnell, which gratified her immensely, and the two
went off happy, but so conscious of the enormity of having
given countenance to such desecration of the Sabbath, in
Sunday shooting, that we knew we were safe from their
perhaps inconvenient chatter.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Parnell was always interested in cricket, and I had
a private pitch laid out for him at Eltham in a two-acre
field.  As a young man he had been an enthusiast, and
the captain of his eleven.  He never went to matches,
however, after he entered Parliament.
</p>

<p>
He talked to me much about Avondale.  He loved
the place, and was never tired of planning the alterations
and improvements he meant to make in the old house
when we could marry.  He often went over to Ireland
expressly to see how things were going there, but after
1880 he could never stay even a few days there in peace.
The after-effects of the awful famine, in such terrible cases
of poverty and woe as were brought to his notice the
moment he arrived in his old home, made it impossible
for him to remain there at all.  No one man could deal
charitably with all these poor people and live, and as time
went on Mr. Parnell's visits became necessarily shorter,
for the demands were so many, and the poverty so great,
that he could not carry the burden and continue the political
life necessary to their alleviation.  He told me that
he despaired of ever having a penny in his pocket when
he took me there, as he always hoped to do.
</p>

<p>
He was very fond of the old woman he kept at
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
Avondale in charge of the house, and who attended to his few
needs when he was there; and whenever he went there
he would get me to go to Fortnum and Mason's to buy a
pound of their 4s. a pound tea for the old dame, who much
appreciated this delicious tea, though she of course stewed
it into poison before drinking it.
</p>

<p>
This old servant of his had the most curious ideas on
"first aid to the injured," and when on one occasion
Mr. Parnell had his hand crushed in some machinery at his
Arklow quarries, she dressed the injured fingers with
cobwebs from the cellar walls.  To my astonishment he asked
for cobwebs at Eltham once, when he had cut his finger,
to "wrap it in."  My children, with delighted interest,
produced cobwebs (and spiders) from the cellar, and I had
the greatest difficulty in preventing a "cure" so likely
to produce blood-poisoning.  He accepted the peasant
lore of Ireland with the simplicity of a child, and I still
remember his doubtful "Is that so?" when I told him
it was most dangerous to put anything so dusty as a
cobweb on an open wound.  "Susan Gaffney said cobwebs
would stop the poison.  They all do it," meaning the
peasants.
</p>

<p>
On August 16th, 1882, he was presented with the
freedom of the City of Dublin.  He wished to avoid a
public demonstration, but the Corporation insisted on
making the most of the occasion.

I ride a horse called Tory, a splendid thoroughbred of my

part of the business which I came over for that I have been
able to attend to thus far; having already discovered several
quarries on my own land, much nearer to the railway station
than the one we are working on, and for which we have to
pay a heavy royalty.  I have every confidence that one and
all of them will be found suitable upon trial.  Kerr is rather

<p>
From these quarries at Arklow Parnell supplied the
Dublin Corporation with "setts" for many of the streets
in Dublin.  These setts (granite, pavement kerbing) were
not turned out quickly enough by his men at first, so he
tried the experiment of giving the men a share in the
profits, and this he found answered well in keeping the
supply up to the demand of the corporation.
</p>

<p>
Some of the polished granite work turned out by his
men was beautiful, and a heavy granite garden vase and
a Celtic cross appeared in the London (Irish) Exhibition
and also in the Cork Exhibition.
</p>

<p>
1882-83 was a very anxious time for me, and the nervous
tension caused by the agitation in the political world and
the continual threatenings of violence, intrigue, and
physical force, made privately to Parnell, against him and
others, was so great that, by the end of '83, if I had not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
had my lover's health to care for I should myself have
broken down altogether.  As it was, there were days when
the slightest sound or movement was an agony to me in
the throes of neuralgia brought on by the overstrain of the
nerves.  But for his sake I concealed my misery of pain
as well as I could, and in so doing won back a measure
of health for myself, which would perhaps have been lost
to me had I been able to give way to my "nerves."
</p>

<p>
During this time I attended the sittings of the House
as often as I was able, going up to town as soon as I
could leave my aunt for the night, so that I might hear
Parnell if he spoke, and in any case drive home with him.
We always drove home in a hansom cab, as we both
loved the cool of the night or of the early morning air.
</p>

<p>
During these anxious days I did not let Parnell have
one-half of the threatening and other worrying letters he
received.  He brought me his letters and parcels from the
House, and from a London address he had, to be sorted
out.  I gave him those for his secretary's answering, any
personal ones I thought he would wish to see, and just
as many "threats" as I thought would make him a little
careful of himself for my sake.  The bulk of the "warnings,"
threats of murder, and invitations to murder I kept
to myself, fearing that he would worry himself on my
account and object to my continual "shadowing" of him,
which I considered his chief protection.  He always carried
a revolver in his pocket during this time, and insisted on
my being similarly provided when I drove home with him
at night.
</p>

<p>
These precautions may appear fantastic in these later
sober times, but they were very necessary during that time
of lawlessness and unrest in Ireland, when the prophecy
made by Parnell to me ere he finally decided to leave
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
Kilmainham on the Treaty had become fact: "If I turn to
the Government I turn away from them&mdash;and then?"
</p>

<p>
The force of his personality was carrying him through
the seething of the baffled hatred he would not use, but
not without a danger so real and so acute that many a time
I was tempted to throw his honour to the winds and
implore from the Government the protection he would have
died rather than ask for himself.  But I held on to the
end till the sheer force of his dauntless courage and proud
will broke down the secret intrigue of spleen that, held
by him back from England's governance, would have
revenged itself upon the holding hand, had it dared.
</p>

<p>
There was a lonely part of the road between London
and Eltham after going through Lee, over a common
where, to the right, was a deep ditch, and, beyond, the
land of (the late) Mr. Blenkiorn, breeder of racehorses.
There were no houses near in those days, and on
moonlight nights we could see a long way on each side of a
rather desolate bit of country.  The moon which gave
light also gave shadows, and more than once from some
way off we saw the shadow of a man running behind the
hedge on the way we had to pass.  I always took the side
of the hansom near the park, as I thought it would conceal
to some degree the fact of Parnell's being there.  I knew,
too, that the fact of my being a woman was still some
little protection, but I took the precaution of telling the
driver to drive quickly and not stop for anyone at any
lonely point in the road.  Once, to my horror, when we
were nearly over the common, I saw a man rise from the
ditch and the glint of steel in the moonlight.  The man
driving saw it, too, and, with a lurch that threw us forward
in the cab, he lashed his horse into a gallop.  I could just
see that the man threw up his arms as he staggered
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
backwards into the ditch and a shot rang out; but nothing
dreadful had happened after all.  The man had obviously
slipped as he sprang up the bank, and, in throwing up his
arms to recover his balance, his pistol had gone off&mdash;for
neither of ours had been discharged.  So this exciting
drive had no more serious consequences than the rather
heavy price of the cabman's putting up in the village till
day brought him renewed confidence in the safety of the
London road.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes after a late sitting Parnell and I would get
some coffee at the early coffee stalls for workmen on the
way from London.  In the early morning half-light, when
the day was just beginning to break, we loved to watch
drowsy London rubbing the sleep from her eyes, hastening
her labouring sons upon their way to ease the later
waking of their luxurious brothers.  Parnell was always
interested in manual labourers; he loved to watch them at
work, and he liked to talk to them of their work and of
their homes.  A man with a hammer or a pick-axe was
almost an irresistible attraction to him, and he would often
get me to stand and watch the men engaged on a road
or harbour work.
</p>

<p>
About this time (it was in 1883) Mr. (afterwards Sir)
Howard Vincent, head of the Detective Department of
Scotland Yard, sent a note to the House of Commons
asking Parnell to see him for a few minutes, as he had an
important communication to make to him.  Parnell was
just going to speak, so he brought me the note up to the
Ladies' Gallery, and, hastily putting it into my hand,
said: "See to this for me."
</p>

<p>
It was a morning sitting, and I hurried off to Scotland
Yard hoping to get back in time to hear Parnell speak,
and yet anxious to hear what the note meant.  I was shown
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
into Sir Howard Vincent's private room directly I arrived,
and he expressed great pleasure, as well as great surprise,
at seeing me.  I showed him his note to Parnell, and
asked him to what it referred.  He answered that the
"officials" all considered the matter serious, and that the
Government were prepared to give Mr. Parnell protection
if he wished it.
</p>

<p>
I told him that Mr. Parnell would, I was sure, not
like that at all, and, after a long conversation of no
particular definiteness, Sir Howard said: "I do not think you
believe in this particular threat against Mr. Parnell, do
you, Mrs. O'Shea?"
</p>

<p>
I replied: "Well, it does seem rather like a hoax to
me.  Would you mind letting me see the 'letter of
warning'?"  He laughed and said: "Not at all, but I've torn
it up and flung it into the waste-paper basket."
</p>

<p>
I promptly picked up the basket in question and turned
it over on his table, saying: "Let us piece it together."  He
pretended to help me for a few moments, as I neatly
put together various uninteresting documents, and then,
with a deprecating smile, swept them all together, saying:
"It is your game, Mrs. O'Shea; you are too clever.  Why
didn't you send Mr. Parnell round?" and we parted with
laughing expressions of goodwill and amusement on his
part that we had not been taken in.
</p>

<p>
The Government, of course, were bent on forcing
"police protection" on Parnell as a convenience to
themselves and a means of ascertaining the extent of his
influence over the Invincibles.  The Government did not
trust Parnell, and they wished to frighten him into care
of himself and thus weaken the trust of the Irish in him.
</p>

<p>
One evening in 1882 or 1883, when Parnell and I were
waiting at Brighton station to catch the train to London,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
we noticed that there was much crowding round the
book-stall placards and much excitement among buyers of
newspapers.  Parnell did not wish to be recognized, as he was
supposed at that time to be in Ireland; but, hearing
Gladstone's name mentioned by a passer-by, our curiosity got
the better of our caution and we went to get a paper.
Parnell, being so tall a man, could see over the heads of the
crowd, and, reading the placard, turned back without
getting a paper to tell me that the excitement was over the
report of "the assassination of Mr. Parnell."  I then
asked him to get into the train so that we should run no
risk of his being known, and managed to get through the
crowd to buy a paper myself.  How the report arose we
never knew, but at that time, when every post brought
Parnell some threat of violence and my nerves were jarred
and tense with daily fear for him, it took all my fortitude
to answer his smile and joke at the unfounded report which
left me sick and shaken.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mr. Forster made his notorious attack upon Mr. Parnell
in February, 1883, accusing him of encouraging and
conniving at murder, outrage, and treachery.  On his return
home Parnell showed, as he would not deign to show in
the House, a fierce joy in the false move of his enemies
and the scorn and contempt of the lack of control which
could lead a politician of Forster's experience into such a
<i>faux pas</i> as this personal attack on him.  Here, then, he
had what he wanted; in this attack was the repudiation of
those charges, made by the "extremists" in Ireland and
America, of pandering to the Government&mdash;made by them
ever since he left Kilmainham on the Treaty&mdash;here was
another cord to bind the Nationalist forces together without
in any way repudiating that Treaty.  Here was a fresh
weapon given into his hand by an ex-Government official
who could not govern his personal spleen by political
intelligence.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said to me, when I asked him if he did not
mean to answer Forster at all, "I shall not answer.  I shall
let him hang himself with his own rope."
</p>

<p>
But the Party would not have this, and urged him so
strongly that he did&mdash;not answer&mdash;but show his contempt
of the whole thing and of the English politicians who had
played their hand so badly.  He said to me before he started
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
for the House: "By the judgment of the Irish people only
do I, and will I, stand or fall," and this he repeated in
the House.
</p>

<p>
The astonishment of the House was unbounded.  It
had been prepared for anything but this scornful
repudiation of the right of the English to judge him&mdash;for a
downright denial of the charges made, for a skilful fencing
with the arguments.  The speech of Parnell was a challenge
to war.  Impassive as ever, betraying no slightest
sign of emotion, he tore up the accusations and threw them
scornfully in the face of his accuser.[<a id="chap21fn1text"></a><a href="#chap21fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
Some time afterwards, in an interview I had with him,
Mr. Gladstone referred to this declaration of Parnell's&mdash;that
he would stand or fall only by the judgment of the
Irish people.
</p>

<p>
He said: "You know Mr. Parnell's inmost feelings
better than others; does this truly represent his mind,
Mrs. O'Shea?"
</p>

<p>
I answered, as I could truly do: "Yes, Mr. Gladstone,
that is his only and absolute ideal.  I may say Ireland's is
the only voice he regards as having any authority over
him in the whole world."
</p>

<p>
"Yet Mr. Parnell is so much an Englishman in his
coldness and reserve?"
</p>

<p>
"He is a paradox, Mr. Gladstone, the enigma of genius
herself, a volcano capped with snow.  Englishman himself,
at least he is descended from Englishmen, he hates
England and the English and does not understand them;
he loves Ireland and her people through and through,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
understands them absolutely, and is in nature as apart and
aloof from the Irish nature as you are yourself."
</p>

<p>
The hard, flint-like eyes softened a little in the eagle
face as the G.O.M. answered with a little sigh: "I have
much sympathy with his ambitions for Ireland, Mrs. O'Shea.
His is a curious personality; you are right, I
think&mdash;yes, a paradox indeed, but a wonderful man!"
</p>

<p>
At the end of June, 1883, Parnell went over to conduct
Mr. Healy's election at Monaghan (an Ulster stronghold),
for which division he was returned a month after he had
quitted Richmond Prison.
</p>

<p>
He immediately afterwards (on July 4) attended the
Cork banquet given in his honour.  He wrote the following
letter to me to allay the fears I had expressed in regard to
certain political actions which he here repudiates and
which had reached my ears from other sources:&mdash;

</p>

<p class="letter">
When I received your note I at once determined to go over
to you to-morrow morning and to give up my engagement to
speak at the Cork banquet to-morrow night, as I knew my
own was very much troubled about something, and felt sure
that I could comfort and reassure her.  I have since been
besieged the whole evening by entreaties and threats not to
throw over Cork, and it has been represented to me, and with
truth, that half the result of the Monaghan victory will be
lost if I leave Cork to the Whigs and my enemies.  I have
been very much perplexed and dragged in different ways, but
have at this hour (2 a.m.) made up my mind to ask my own
Wifie to suspend her judgment for another twenty-four hours
about whatever is tormenting her, to place some little confidence
in her husband's honour and fidelity for that short time,
and to believe that he now swears to her, and that he will
repeat the same oath to her on Thursday evening, that whatever
statement has been made about him which is calculated to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
lower him in his wife's opinion in the slightest degree is a
foul lie.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I feel that I can ask this of my own Wifie, and that she
will not withdraw her confidence and love from her own husband
until he can return and defend himself.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I shall leave for Cork by to-morrow morning's train at
nine o'clock, speak at banquet, and return by night mail the
same day to Dublin, and be in time to leave Dublin by mail
train for London on Thursday morning.  Let me know at
Palace Chambers where I shall see you on Thursday evening.

<p>
Just before Christmas in 1883 I took a furnished house
in Brighton for three months for my children.  I had
arranged to go into a house in Second Avenue, which both
Parnell and I liked, but Willie came down and insisted
on my taking one facing the sea in Medina Terrace;
so I (with difficulty) got out of my former agreement, and
certainly the house Willie chose was very much pleasanter,
owing to its close proximity to the sea.
</p>

<p>
Willie undertook to stay here to be with the children
while I went back to my aunt (coming myself to Brighton
for one or two days in the week).
</p>

<p>
Willie asked Parnell to come and stay.  He did so,
and Willie and he discussed the Local Government Bill at
all hours, as Parnell wished to find out what the views of
Mr. Chamberlain and the Tories were&mdash;better ascertainable
by Willie than others.
</p>

<p>
I went back to my aunt for Christmas Eve.  It was
bitterly cold, and as the old lady never cared for festivities,
she was soon glad to shut herself up in her warm house
and "forget in slumber the foolish junketings I permit
in my domestics, my love."
</p>

<p>
There was snow that Christmas, very deep at Eltham;
and Parnell, who had joined me there, walked round the
snowy paths of my aunt's place with me in the moonlight.
Now and then he moved with me into the shadow of the
trees as a few lads and men, with the inevitable cornet and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
trombone of a village "band," plunged through the drifts
on their short cut to the old house.  There they sang
Christmas carols to their hearts' content, knowing they
were earning their yearly bonus, to be presented with a
polite message of her "distaste" for carol singing by
"Mrs. Ben's" (as she was affectionately called in the village)
man-servant the next morning.
</p>

<p>
Parnell and I enjoyed that pacing up and down the
wide terrace in the snowy moonlight.  The snow had
drifted up against the old urns and the long, low balustrade
that divided the north and south lawns; and the great
shadows of the beech trees looked unfamiliar and
mysterious&mdash;pierced here and there, where the blanket
covering of snow had dropped off, by the cold glitter of
moonlight on the whiteness.
</p>

<p>
Right away to the south lay the "Chase," leading away
to Chislehurst, wide, cold, and lonely in the moonlight,
and I told Parnell that the cloud shadows that flitted over
the glistening whiteness were the phantoms of the hunters
of King John's time, who used to hunt over this ground,
renewing their sport in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
Parnell loved to hear these little imaginations, and I
loved to tell them to him for the sake of seeing the grave
smile come, and of hearing the naïve "Is that so?" of
his appreciation.
</p>

<p>
We walked up and down in the moonlight till the
carols died away, and we heard the church clocks strike
twelve.  Then we stood together to listen to the Christmas
bells sound clear and sharp from many villages on the
frosty air, while Parnell again spoke to me of his belief
that the soul after death resumed life in the planet under
whose influence it was born.  He spoke of his belief in a
personal destiny and fate, against which it was useless
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
for mortals to contend or fight, and how he believed that
certain souls had to meet and become one, till in death
the second planet life parted them until the sheer longing
for one another brought them together again in after
ages.[<a id="chap21fn3text"></a><a href="#chap21fn3">3</a>]
</p>

<p>
I said, "But it seems so lonely like that!" and he
answered, "It is lonely; that is why I am so afraid always
of death, and why I hope with every bit of me that we
shall die together."
</p>

<p>
The next day I went to Brighton to see the children
for Christmas, and in the New Year Willie went to Ireland,
returning to Brighton to stay with the children for a short
time before they came home in February and he went to
Lisbon.

Parnell was always unselfish and most considerate
when I was ill, and once when I was very weak after an
illness of some duration he returned home to Eltham in
broad daylight in a hansom cab, triumphantly supporting
one end of a large couch, the other end of which spread
its upholstered length over the roof.  This invalid's chair
he with the help of my maids, arranged in my sitting-room,
adjusting its complicated "rests" with earnest
abstraction, after which he led the procession up to my
room, and in spite of my amused protests carried me down
and placed me on the couch amid cushions and shawls,
and spent a happy evening in "watching me" as I lay
comfortably on my new possession.
</p>

<p>
In 1884 we ran down to Hastings for a few days in
the middle of the Session, when my aunt's old friend
came to stay with her and gave me freedom.  Parnell
delighted in these sudden "run-away" visits to the sea
when the House was in full swing of business, and said
they braced and freshened him up more than anything
else could do.  We stayed at the Queen's Hotel, and
Parnell revelled in the sudden freedom from politics&mdash;casting
all thought and care from him as we walked by
the sea and gave ourselves up to the enjoyment of the
fresh salt air.
</p>

<p>
He was hugely pleased, on going into a shop in Robertson
Street for notepaper, to find some embossed with the
monogram "K.P." in blue and gold.  He declared it was
a good omen, and bought me more boxes of it than I
could use for many years.  He also bought me a little
red diary, after long and earnest efforts in selection.  Red
he did not like much, as he said it was the sanguinary hue
of English oppression; but diaries can apparently only
be bound in red, green, or purple, and purple was the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
colour of sorrow, and green the most painful expression
of all ill-luck!
</p>

<p>
This diary was to make up to me for my natural
indignation at, nearly, his first act on returning to me from
some absence.  He had gone over to the fire and caught
sight of my diary, bound in green, that I had inadvertently
left on the mantelpiece.  With an exclamation of
horror he had thrown it straight into the fire, holding me
back from the rescue I struggled to attempt, and only
replying to my indignant protests that he was sorry if
the contents were really so valuable as I said, but anything
between green covers was better burnt!
</p>

<p>
In these short visits to the seaside we always looked
about for a house that Parnell could buy later on, but as
he always kept a regretful eye upon Brighton, where it
was inexpedient that we should be seen much together, we
never really settled on one for purchase, though he rented
one in Eastbourne with that idea, only to discover that a
brother of his was living there.  When we had a few
hours to spare we had very happy times hunting round
Sussex in the neighbourhood of Brighton (Brighton air
did him so much good), hoping to find a suitable country
house, but the train service was always a difficulty, except
in the town itself.

deceived, and that they have been cheered by those who ought to be
ashamed of themselves, that they have been led astray as to the right mode
of governing a noble, a brave, a generous and an impulsive people."

<p>
In 1885 I had a new room built on to my house at
Eltham, adjoining my sitting-room and leading into the
greenhouse, and thence to the garden.  Parnell and I
took the greatest interest in the building of this room; he
superintended every detail, saw that the cement was laid
to the proper depth under the flooring, and sent to
Avondale for sufficient sweet-chestnut wood to have the room
panelled half-way up and to make beautiful, heavy
double-doors, window settings and the mantelpiece and fittings.
It was a very comfortable and warm room when finished,
and, to celebrate its completion&mdash;it was to be Parnell's
own study and workroom&mdash;I photographed him in it,
sitting in his own special easy chair, surrounded by his
assaying paraphernalia and holding his pestle and
mortar.  This photograph was published years ago without
permission or acknowledgment by one or other of two
persons to whom I had given it, after my husband's
death, as a very private and special memento of him.  It
hurt me much when I first knew of it&mdash;but people do
these things.
</p>

<p>
Early in 1885 Parnell bought a new horse in Ireland
which he arranged to bring to England, and subsequently
brought others over.  The two letters which follow refer
to these matters, and were written to me in case the horses
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
should be noticed arriving in Eltham and the fact reported
to Captain O'Shea.

<p class="letter">
MY DEAR MRS. O'SHEA,&mdash;I have sent two horses to London
to-day (Euston) and should feel very much obliged if you would
allow them to stand in your stables for a few days, until I can
make other arrangements.
</p>

<p class="letter">
They will reach Euston about 1 p.m. to-morrow.  Could
you find two careful men to meet them?  One saddle is gone
with the horses, so another saddle would be necessary.  They
should be walked carefully through London, as one of them
specially is very shy and unused to town.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I am going over to Liverpool to-night.  I enclose order
for the horses.&mdash;-Yours very truly, CHAS. S. PARNELL.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Parnell rented some stables fairly near my house for
his horses, and took much interest in their welfare.  He
was not a man who had very much knowledge of horses,
but he was a fine horseman, and on his hunter President,
a beautiful horse of sixteen hands and a weight-carrier,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P232"></a>232}</span>
he looked remarkably well.  He took a scientific interest
in the shoeing of the horses and, to the great annoyance
of his grooms, would constantly try new methods of
shoeing in order to deaden the "jar" of the contact of the
road.  This trial of new methods proved a boon to my horse
Dictator&mdash;given me by Parnell&mdash;for the tenderness of his
feet was completely cured when Parnell, dead against the
conservative ideas of my stableman, insisted on his having
leathers inserted between Dictator's foot and shoe.
</p>

<p>
This horse Dictator was a great pleasure to us, though
he pulled rather badly.  He was very fast and extraordinarily
sure-footed, keeping his feet in the worst frost, even
when driven on the slippery London paving in hard night
frosts.  He would trot away to London in much less time
than Parnell could get there by any other means.  Parnell
did not drive well, leaving the reins slack upon the horse's
back, so that he had no control over it in any emergency.
My nervousness in this was so great that he very
good-naturedly left all the driving to me, saying: "Well,
that's how the jarveys drive in Ireland!" in answer to my
plaintive "I've never seen anyone drive like that."
</p>

<p>
President was a very solid horse, in mind as well as in
body, and once when Parnell had ridden him up to New
Cross in a frost President sat down violently and was so
impressed with the safety of his position that he refused
to get up again until Parnell&mdash;who was of immense
muscular strength&mdash;with the help of a couple of stalwart
policemen, literally lifted him to his feet.
</p>

<p>
Parnell then went into an adjacent saddler's shop to
buy a "rubber" to give President a rub down and, finding
a rather original make of pocket-book on the counter, with
beautifully-sewn leather covers, became so immersed in
the selection of one for me that at length an irate policeman
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
looked in to order him to remove his horse at once,
as it was causing "an obstruction!"  Parnell, recalled
to the problem of how to get President and himself
to Westminster Bridge, where his servant was waiting
to take the horse, proceeded to rub him down while
considering the matter, thereby delighting the crowd of
onlookers.
</p>

<p>
The policeman besought him to "get on the 'orse, sir,
and ride hoff," before the whole street got "'eld hup,"
but Parnell gently declined, as he knew that President
had now no chance of keeping his feet on the ice-coated
pavement.  After fully considering the matter he found
the chief thing was to get himself out of the crowd as
quickly as possible, and, slipping a little comfort into the
constable's hand, he ordered him to put the horse up at
the nearest stables and drove off, ignoring all queries and
protests.
</p>

<p>
He sent me a telegram from the House to assure me
of his safe arrival, but forgot all about his waiting
servant, who, after some hours, not daring to return home,
telegraphed to me to know what he was to do, as his master
had not arrived.  The whole thing amused Parnell
intensely, but unfortunately he had given the policeman the
name of Prescott, and, in absence of mind, sent his groom
the next day to find and bring back the horse of
"Mr. Stewart."  It was a most expensive trial of President's
utility.  The pocket-book I still use daily, and prize very
highly; it is as perfect, though much worn, as when he
bought it, some twenty-six years ago.
</p>

<p>
After my old collie Elfie died, Parnell offered to get
me another dog, and, as I wanted an Irish wolf-hound,
he and I went to see one that was advertised for sale.  It
was a magnificent animal, but we had much doubt as to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
its true breed, and decided that Mr. Parnell should not
buy it.
</p>

<p>
He then suggested bringing me an Irish setter the
next time he went to Ireland, and, as the idea pleased me,
he brought a half-grown setter given him by Mr. Corbett,
M.P., who said this dog, Grouse, was the very best he
had ever had.  Grouse became at once the constant
companion and pleasure of his master and myself.  He was a
beautiful dog, and most faithful and affectionate.
Mr. Parnell would tease him by pretending to be jealous when
Grouse lay at my feet with his head on my foot, and when
the dog rose with the dignity that always characterized
him, and went over to Parnell, resting his head on his
knee and assuring him of his absolute devotion, I would in
my turn despair at having no dog to love me.
</p>

<p>
After a few moments of this game poor Grouse would
sit exactly between us, looking from one to the other, and
whining at the impossibility of pleasing us both at once.
Then Parnell would move to my side on the sofa so that
Grouse could rest his chin on our clasped hands, to his
great contentment.  The dog always slept in Parnell's
room, and, in his last illness, when the doctors wished to
have Grouse removed, Parnell would not allow it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Corbett was very sad when he heard that Grouse
had become a lady's pet, as the old sportsman considered
it a sin to "spoil" a gun dog; but I think that if he had
known the pleasure Grouse gave "the Chief" he would
have been glad that the dog should have exchanged the
Wicklow Mountains for the hated Saxon's home.  Parnell
took Grouse over for the grouse-shooting one season and
telegraphed to me that he had done very well, but he soon
brought him back to me.
</p>

<p>
Another dog that Parnell brought home to me from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
Ireland was a mongrel Irish terrier that he had found
wandering in the streets of Killaloe.  He had been dreadfully
starved and ill-used, and was quite savage when handed
over to me at Brighton with muzzle and chain on, but
with kindness and good feeding he soon became as devoted
to us as Grouse was, and with him used thoroughly to
enjoy following Parnell when he rode over the Downs
for his daily exercise.
</p>

<p>
After we went to Brighton Parnell would give the dogs
a swim in the sea every day, and Grouse's strong
swimming was a great delight to his master.  Pincher, the
terrier, was the cause of much anxiety, as he used to swim
right out to sea&mdash;so far that we lost sight of the little dark
head&mdash;and Parnell had very often to get a boat out and
fetch the exhausted little beast back.  This little dog lived
for many years after his master's death (Grouse only two
years), but he would never allow another man to touch
him without trying to bite him.  He was fond of Parnell,
but always on guard with other men, though quite
good-tempered with women.  Parnell used to say that Pincher
must have been so badly treated by some man that he had
learned distrust of all males.  Many a time he came home
from his rides with rueful amusement at the exaggerated
value placed upon their legs by shepherds or labourers he
had met on the Downs who had been bitten by Pincher
with a careless indiscrimination that at last earned him a
muzzle.
</p>

<p>
Parnell also brought to Eltham a very old setter,
Ranger.  He had been a splendid dog, and now his limbs
were too feeble to follow his faithful heart in his master's
sport.  So Mr. Parnell took pity on him, and asked
Mr. Corbett to let him have the dog for a lady who would care
for his old age, and Ranger came to us, spending the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P236"></a>236}</span>
evening of his life in basking on the sunny lawn at Eltham,
wagging a dignified tail of appreciation and greeting to
those of us he met on his stiff walks about the place or
dreaming his doggie dreams of the sport of the past, happy
and cared for till he died.

The following letter was sent to <i>United Ireland</i> on
April 11, 1885, in regard to the proposed visit of the Prince
of Wales to Ireland:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
You ask for my views regarding the visit of the Prince of
Wales.  In reply, I desire to say that if the usages of the
Constitution existed in Ireland as they do in England there
would, to my judgment, be no inconsistency in those who
believe in the limited monarchy as the best form of government
taking a suitable part in the reception of the Prince.
But in view of the fact that the Constitution has never been
administered in Ireland according to its spirit and precedents,
that the power of the Crown as wielded by Earl Spencer and
other Viceroys is despotic and unlimited to the last degree,
and that in the present instance the Royal personage is to be
used by the two English political parties in Ireland for the
purpose of injuring and insulting the Irish Nationalist Party,
and of impeding, if possible, their work, I fail to see upon what
ground it can be claimed from any lover of constitutional
government under a limited monarchy that the Prince is
entitled to a reception from the independent and patriotic people
of Ireland, or to any recognition save from the garrison of
officials and landowners and place-hunters who fatten upon the
poverty and misfortunes of the country.  Let me suggest a
parallel.  Would it be tolerated in England for a moment if
the Government, for their own party purposes, on the eve of
a general election, were to use the Prince of Wales as an
electioneering agent in any section of the country, and were
to send him upon a Royal progress in order to embarrass their
political opponents?  The breach of constitutional privilege
becomes still graver when we consider that it is the march of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
a nation which is now sought to be impeded&mdash;the fruition of a
long struggle and of many sacrifices which the adventitious aid
of this Royal visit is enlisted to injure.  I have, however, every
confidence that our people, having been suitably forewarned,
will not allow their hospitable nature and cordial disposition
to carry them into any attitude which might be taken as one
of condonation for the past or satisfaction with the present state
of affairs.
</p>

<p class="letter">
CHARLES S. PARNELL.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This letter was written at Eltham, and there was a
laughing battle between us over the writing of it.  I
threatened to make him hang out "Union Jacks" from
every window of Avondale if he made things unpleasant
in Ireland for the Prince, and he, in pretended horror,
wrote the above, and tossed it to me for the alterations
(which I, of course, did not make) that my "English
prejudices" demanded.  But he seriously believed that this
visit of the Prince to Ireland was timed by the advisers of
his Royal Highness with singular and malicious advertence
to the State of the political situation, and he commented
most strongly upon the poverty of imagination and chivalry
of a great country such as England who could find no
better use for her Prince than that of an electioneering
agent.

SEASIDE HOLIDAYS

<p class="poem">
  "<i>Green leaves a-floating,<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In May, 1886, I took my children to the Queen's Hotel,
Eastbourne, for a change, and, after a few days spent in
looking for lodgings, I settled them in St. John's Road.
Parnell enjoyed the bathing at Eastbourne greatly, and
was much distressed that the weakness of my heart
prevented my joining him in his swims, and that boating
had most disastrous effects on me.
</p>

<p>
He was boyishly determined that I should at any rate
join him in some way in his sea "sports," and one warm
May evening he insisted that if I went into the sea fully
dressed it could not hurt me.  I thought it would at any
rate be most uncomfortable, but to please him I held
tightly to his arm while we waded far out to sea till the
waves came to my shoulder and threw me off my feet.
</p>

<p>
He held me tightly, laughing aloud as the ripple of
waves and wind caught my hair and loosed it about my
shoulders; and, as I grew cold and white, my wonderful
lover carried me, with all my weight of soaked clothing,
back to the shore, kissing the wet hair that the wind twisted
about his face and whispering the love that almost
frightened me in its strength.  Luckily the dusk of
evening had come down upon us, and I was able to get back
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P239"></a>239}</span>
to the house in my wet things, half-walking and
half-carried by Parnell, without unduly shocking Eastbourne's
conventions.
</p>

<p>
As I thought I should be able to be away from my
aunt, with occasional flying visits to her, for about two
months, Parnell had two of our horses brought down to
Eastbourne.  He had during that time to go to London
and Ireland, but it was on the whole a peaceful little
interlude in his strenuous political life, and we were very
happy.  He rode his horse President in the morning, and
afterwards I drove him far out into the country around
Eastbourne with Dictator in my phaeton.
</p>

<p>
We often drove out to Birling Gap&mdash;a favourite haunt
of ours&mdash;and there we selected a site for the ideal house of
our dreams; a place where one could hear nothing but the
beating of the surf on the rocks below and the wild call
of the sea-birds.  He loved that place, where we could be
absolutely alone save for the coastguardsman along the
cliff, who never intruded his interesting conversation, but
who was always ready for a chat when we cared to hear
his stories of the sea.
</p>

<p>
It was impossible to drive near the place, so we had
to leave Dictator and the phaeton far off on the last bit
possible to drive upon.  Parnell had an easy method of
"hitching" a horse to something, in the firm faith that
he would find it there on return a few hours later, and this
made me very uneasy where my far from patient Dictator
was concerned.  Parnell would settle the horse with a feed,
in charge of his groom, well sheltered behind a hill, and
take a fantastic pleasure in observing the sulky gloom of
the young man's face after an hour or so of this isolated
meditation.
</p>

<p>
Parnell had a great love of sea-storms, and when there
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P240"></a>240}</span>
was a gale blowing from the west, and rough weather
assured, he loved to get me out to Birling Gap to listen to
the roar of the sea and the screaming of the wind as it blew
around us, nearly carrying us off our feet.  He would tie
his coat about me, and hold me firmly against the wind
as it tore about us, and while we gazed out at the raging
waves he would exclaim: "Isn't this glorious, my Queen?
Isn't it alive?"
</p>

<p>
Our coastguardsman friend always seemed somewhat
pleased to see us, though undoubtedly he thought us odd
in our amusements.  I have often thought since that if
we had built our house in that isolated loveliness, where
the sound of the sea and moan of the wind were incessant,
there would have been some truth in what was said afterwards
as to our house in Walsingham Terrace, that it was
so "terribly dreary."
</p>

<p>
On one occasion we drove to Pevensey, and, passing
the station on our return, a crowd from some local train
came pouring out.  Parnell asked me to pull up to let the
crowd go by; but to his consternation this attracted the
attention of some young men in the crowd, who at once
recognized him, and, waving their hats, cried "Parnell,
Parnell!" with that horrible emphasis on the "nell" that
is so prevalent.  Parnell, lifting his hat, urged me in an
agonized tone to drive on, but it was too late.  The crowd
clustered about us, insisting on shaking hands with him,
and throwing covertly interested glances at his companion.
They would not let us go on till he had made a little
impromptu speech on current affairs, after which we drove
off amid cheers.
</p>

<p>
Parnell never swore, and "Goodness gracious!"
learned from his nurse in extreme youth, was the strongest
expression he ever used, but the dull, quiet anger such a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P241"></a>241}</span>
contretemps as this caused him would, I felt, have been
relieved could he have acquired the habit of "language."  This
little incident at Pevensey would lead to newspaper
paragraphs, and it was hard we could not have a few days'
quiet amusement without having it boomed through the
country.  However, a brilliant thought struck me.  If we
were to be bothered by paragraphs let them be our own!
So we drew up by the wayside, and concocted a paragraph
which told an over-interested world that "Mr. Parnell had
been staying at Hastings with his sister, and on visiting
Pevensey with her had," etc., etc.  This, forwarded to
the Press Association, left us in peace at Eastbourne to
complete our little holiday.
</p>

<p>
Apropos of Parnell's "Goodness gracious," he was at
first quite unconscious of his use of the words, and it was
only on Willie's plaintive query as to why he did not
d&mdash;-n like other men, instead of using "that foolish and
vulgar expression," he became aware of it.  He then
admitted with some amusement that he liked the homely
old expression and did not d&mdash;-n merely because it never
occurred to him to do so.
</p>

<p>
On the cliffs towards Beachy Head is a house that at
that time was built but not quite finished.  Parnell took
me up to see it, and suggested that it might be a charming
seaside retreat for us, even though not the ideal we always
had in our minds.  This house then had a beautiful and
wide outlook over the sea, and I liked it so much that
he arranged to take it on a three years' agreement directly
it was finished.  He wanted to have all the walls
distempered instead of papered, and we spent many hours over
this and the selection of the Minton tiles for the hall.  The
details of the house interested him greatly, and one day
when the men working there had gone to dinner Parnell
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P242"></a>242}</span>
showed me how to lay the tiles with so much energy that
we had finished their work by the time the men returned.
He then insisted upon my writing "Heatherbell Cottage"
on a tile, which he proceeded to inlay over the front door,
earning the comment from the men working there that he
seemed to know as much about the "job" as they did.
</p>

<p>
He then turned his attention to making a smooth lawn
in our little garden, spending hours pulling a roller up
and down, while I sat on the steps writing from his
dictation "A Proposed Constitution for the Irish and the
English Peoples"&mdash;a production that excited the greatest
wrath in the minds of some of the Irish Party at a
subsequent meeting.  I do not think that the English
members of Parliament were ever made acquainted with
the benefits proposed for their consideration under this
"Constitution."
</p>

<p>
This Constitution was more fun than anything else.
Parnell undoubtedly put it before certain members of the
Irish Party instead of one drafted by his own hand.  He
told me afterwards that they looked "absolutely ill" when
they saw my handwriting, so he would not withdraw it
in favour of his own&mdash;till later.
</p>

<p>
I was sitting on the doorstep of our new house one
day, idly watching Parnell build a bank that was to be
turfed over to keep us from prying eyes, when he stopped
suddenly and, leaning on his spade, said: "I am a poet!
And descended from the poet, Thomas Parnell."
</p>

<p>
"Not a poet," I answered gently, "even though
descended from one."
</p>

<p>
"I am a poet myself; give me a pencil and paper."  And,
throwing himself down beside me, he wrote down
the following verse proudly.  "It came to me while I was
digging," he said as he tossed it over to me, "and it is a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P243"></a>243}</span>
real poem, and makes me a real poet.  It's as good as any
of Tom Parnell's stuff!"
</p>

<p>
I was forced to confess that I agreed with him, as I do
now, that it was and is as good as, and better to me than,
any of Thomas Parnell's stuff, or "the stuff" of any poet
who ever graced the world with song.  This is it:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The grass shall cease to grow,<br />
  The river's stream to run,<br />
  The stars shall ponder in their course,<br />
  No more shall shine the sun;<br />
  The moon shall never wane or grow,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere I shall cease to love you."<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHAS. PARNELL.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
One evening in 1886, on his return from town, Parnell
told me about Mr. O'Brien's Plan of Campaign.  He did
not approve of it, and said that he did not wish to have
anything to do with the working of it, adding: "I shall
let O'Brien run it by himself."
</p>

<p>
Parnell was looking and feeling very ill at this time,
and when Mr. O'Brien took upon himself to call at my
house to see him, entirely uninvited, Parnell was not really
well enough to see him.  He was suffering from nervous
breakdown, chiefly brought on by gastric trouble, which
in its turn was produced by overwork and the strain of
political life.  All through his life Parnell was delicate.
From 1880, when I first met him (and nursed him into
health) to 1891, when he died, it was only by incessant
watchfulness and care that I was able to maintain his
health at all.  It is certainly the fact that only his
indomitable will and power of mind rendered him capable
of enduring the strain of his public life and of the feats
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P244"></a>244}</span>
of strength that few men of far greater physique would
have attempted.
</p>

<p>
It was in allusion to this illness at the time of the visit
of Mr. O'Brien that Parnell said in his speech at the
Eighty Club (May 8, 1888): "I was ill, dangerously ill;
it was an illness from which I have not entirely recovered
up to this day.  I was so ill that I could not put pen to
paper, or even read the newspaper.  I knew nothing
about the movement until weeks after it had started, and
even then I was so feeble that for several months&mdash;absolutely
up to the meeting of Parliament&mdash;I was positively
unable to take part in any public matter, and was scarcely
able to do so for months afterwards.  But, if I had been
in a position to advise, I candidly submit to you that I
should have advised against it."
</p>

<p>
Mr. O'Brien called again to see Parnell during the
time he was so ill, and he left his room for the first time
to go down to the sitting-room to see him.  They had
a long talk over the Plan of Campaign and other matters,
and the interview left Parnell so exhausted that he was
very ill again for some days afterwards.
</p>

<p>
Long after he told me, "All I got for getting up to see
O'Brien was that he went about telling people that I was
insane."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Parnell had been feeling low and depressed all
through the summer of this year, and towards the autumn
I became very much worried about his lassitude and
general feeling of illness.  I tried different diets without
effect, and, thinking it might be better for him to go
straight to bed after "the House," I took a house in London
for him and settled him there, but he could not bear the
loneliness and came back to Eltham as usual after a few
nights.  In November he became worse, and I insisted
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P245"></a>245}</span>
upon his consulting a doctor, suggesting Sir Henry
Thompson, as I had heard he was very clever.  I took
him to London on the afternoon of November 6, in a closed
carriage, and he was feeling so weak and nervous that he
asked me to go in and see Sir Henry first for him.  His
nerves had completely broken down and I felt terribly
worried about him.  He stayed in the waiting-room while
I went into the consulting-room.  Here Sir Henry hurried
in from dinner, extremely irritable at being disturbed at
such an unseemly hour for a "Mr. Charles Stewart," whom
he did not know.  "Look, look, <i>look</i>!  Look at the clock!
What's the matter?  I have a consultation in a few
minutes!"
</p>

<p>
I was very glad that the door between the rooms was
shut, as I felt that such a reception in his state of nerves
would have caused Parnell to leave the house without
waiting for an interview.  I began to point out that "my"
patient could not, in such a low state, face such an ungenial
reception.  So he permitted me to explain a little about
Mr. Stewart's ill-health, and as he was kindness itself,
losing every trace of impatience, he helped Parnell into
his room, where, after receiving a smile of assurance from
Parnell, and having seen the relief in his face, I left them
together, feeling what an inestimable blessing it was to
have placed Parnell's health in such a haven of security
in so far as human skill could aid it.
</p>

<p>
The knowledge, throughout the rest of Parnell's life,
of being able to obtain Sir Henry Thompson's advice was
a great comfort to this overwrought man.
</p>

<p>
Sir Henry Thompson warned me that it was most
important for Mr. Parnell's health that his feet should
be kept very warm, as his circulation was bad.  When
his feet became cold it upset his digestion, and this so
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P246"></a>246}</span>
disorganized his general health that he was then laid up for
several days.  I always insisted upon his frequently
changing his shoes and socks when he was at home, and
gave him a little black bag containing a change whenever
he was sure to be away for a few hours, as I found that the
trouble of the frequent changing was amply compensated
for in warm feet and therefore better health.
</p>

<p>
So curiously inquisitive were some of the Irish Party
about its contents that the little bag with the change of
socks and shoes became an obsession with them till one of
them made the brilliant discovery that "Parnell had boots
and socks in it to save him from wet feet!"  Parnell used
to complain to me when he handed it over to me that I
might see by the different coloured socks that he had kept
his promise of "changing" in town, that &mdash;&mdash;'s eyes
seemed to be boring holes in the bag, and he was really
thinking it would be better to hang the other shoes and
socks round his neck if he must take them about with
him!
</p>

<p>
When Parnell had to go over to Ireland he desired
his secretary, Mr. Campbell, to bring his correspondence
down to me at Eastbourne in order that I might deal with
one or two matters on which he desired immediate intelligence
telegraphed to him in our private code.  He had
long since registered the telegraphic address of "Satellite"
for me that he might be able to telegraph with more
privacy, and this arrangement had proved its usefulness
many times in political and private matters.  He had
himself put together the code words we used, and insisted on
my learning them by heart, to obviate the risk of any
misunderstanding in case of loss.
</p>

<p>
Most of the words used were taken from his assaying
operations, though not all, and were sent as from one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P247"></a>247}</span>
engineer to another about work in hand.  In the code
Willie appeared as "Tailings" and with Middlings, Crude,
Gas, Overseer, Slag, Concentrate, Deposit, and a few other
such words for Gladstone, Chamberlain, and other
politicians, our code was an excellent working medium of
private communication.
</p>

<p>
Before we took the house in Eastbourne we made a
flying visit to Bognor, but this, though in those days a
pretty, fresh, little place, was very difficult to get at, and
impossible from a politician's point of view.  We went
there on a gloriously stormy day, and thoroughly enjoyed
it.  In our search for houses we even got as far as Selsey,
but when, on our going into the house we had come to see,
the caretaker carefully double-locked the door, Parnell
turned with a horrified gesture to me, and insisted upon
leaving at once without going over the house at all.  It
was an omen of misfortune, he said, and we could never
be happy in such a house.
</p>

<p>
I have always thought that one of the greatest charms
of Parnell's personality was the extraordinary simplicity
of his outlook on ordinary life allied to the extremely subtle
trend of his intellect.
</p>

<p>
A man of moods, he never permitted a mood to blind
him to probable, or possible, issues in political matters.
A keen judge of character, he summed up, mentally
docketed, and placed in the pigeon-hole of memory, each
and every man who came into his political vision, and
could thus at any time place, sort, and direct any pawn
of the Irish political game.  Yet in things having no
political significance his simplicity was almost absurd in its
naïveté.
</p>

<p>
An amusing instance of what I mean occurred while
we were at Eastbourne in '86.  There was a boy I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P248"></a>248}</span>
employed about the house at Eltham, who was growing too
fast, and looked as though he would be all the better for
a little sea air.  As I was taking my own servants down to
Eastbourne I took this boy down also for a holiday, since
it made little difference as to expense.  This child was, I
suppose, about fourteen years old, and once as I sat at the
window, sorting Parnell's letters, and enjoying the
morning air, I was suddenly struck with consternation to see
my protégé, Jimmie, escorted up the road between two of
Eastbourne's largest policemen.  I said to Parnell,
"Look!" and, following the direction of my horrified
forefinger, he gazed sadly out at Jimmie, and replied,
"Throwing stones, I'll wager.  <i>More</i> paragraphs,
sweetheart!  You shouldn't have boys about."
</p>

<p>
But the large policeman insisted upon an interview
with "the gentleman," with "Mr. Stewart," and, on my
having the whole party in to hear the worst, we were
informed that poor Jimmie had been caught trying to change
a £50 note at the grocer's shop!  "Mr. Stewart's" cold
gravity of expression changed to one of deprecating
amusement as I glanced indignantly at him.  "I had no
change, constable, so of course sent the boy to change
the note," explained Parnell.  "Told 'em so," threw
in Jimmie, now feeling fairly safe and the centre of
interest.  But Eastbourne policemen are far too unimaginative
to believe that boys of Jimmie's age are to be sent
for change for £50 notes, and it was with the utmost
difficulty we got rid of these stolid guardians of our
pockets.
</p>

<p>
Parnell, after sending the boy for change, had
temporarily forgotten the matter, and no explanation could
convince him that it was the obvious thing that the boy
should be "arrested" on trying to change so large a note.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P249"></a>249}</span>
"Jimmie's a nuisance, but anyone can see that he is
honest," was his conclusion.
</p>

<p>
On one of our excursions, ostensibly to look for a
house, but really as much as anything for the purpose of
getting away for a few hours to the sea, we went to Herne
Bay.  This was a charming and lonely little place then;
a cluster of houses set in green fields and a fresh sea
dashing over the little pier.  It was always on days when the
wind was high that the longing for the sea came over us,
and thus we generally found the sea responding to our
mood.
</p>

<p>
At this little village of Herne Bay the house we saw
was unsuitable, but the day is a memory of salt wind and
rough waves, followed by a picnic dinner at the little inn,
where Parnell ordered a fowl to be roasted, and was
momentarily saddened by my refusal to eat that murdered
bird, which had been so pleasantly finding its own dinner
when he gave the order.

LONDON REMEMBRANCES

<p class="poem">
  "<i>My true love hath my heart and I have his.</i>"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Once when Parnell had to go to Ireland by the morning
mail, after a late sitting of the House, I went up to the
St. Pancras Hotel, where he had a room that night, and
made the waiter bring up a tray into the bedroom, with
a cold bird, some tomatoes and materials for salad dressing,
adding a bottle of still Moselle (Parnell always drank
still Moselle by his doctor's, Sir Henry Thompson's,
orders, and no other wine).  I knew he would be rushed
to catch the train when he returned in the early morning,
and that he would miss the little meal I always had ready
for him, and this missing a meal was very bad for him.
</p>

<p>
When I had prepared the supper table to my liking
I sat down by the open window and watched the flare of
light in the sky and the wide panoramic view of mean
streets and wide spaces I had from this window, of one
of the rooms highest up in this high building; and the
shrieks and oaths of men and women came up to me as they
quarrelled, and the drunken brawls of some past semblance
of humanity floated up to me till dawn brought peace to
the city, as these poor dregs of life slunk back to their dens
to seek the oblivion of sleep.  I shall never forget the
sights and sounds of that night, for never before had the
horror of a great city's streets at night been so forcibly
brought before me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P251"></a>251}</span>
</p>

<p>
In the early dawn Parnell came, and, seeing his supper
there, sat down to eat it without question, as I had known
he would.  He ate in a preoccupied way as he thought
over his speech, and after telling of various points in it,
suddenly said, "Ah, I was really hungry; and you found
some tomatoes.  I'll make the salad if you'll eat some."  So
he made a delicious salad, and we feasted upon it
before I left him to go down to Eltham by the early train,
and to give him time for a short rest before catching the
mail train for Ireland.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"There is one great comfort about this," I used to say
to myself, after two hours' walking up and down that most
uncomfortable station, Waterloo Junction, "and that is
that he always comes at last."  I had often to comfort
myself with that reflection as I waited about at various
stations for Parnell.
</p>

<p>
When he had to be late I often went up to the House
to fetch him out to dinner at a restaurant.  He hated dining
in the House, and there were one or two points in the diet
ordered him by Sir Henry Thompson that I insisted upon
for him where he would not take the trouble to insist for
himself.  After dinner I would drive him nearly back to
the House.  There he got out, and if he felt lonely at the
idea of driving down to Eltham by himself as he sometimes
did, or if he thought he would want to talk to me
again before he came home (as he very often did!) I would
promise to wait for him at some station, so that he could
find me without observation.  It would have been much
more comfortable, of course, for me to have waited in a
house or rooms somewhere, but people were so extraordinarily
curious about Parnell that it would have been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P252"></a>252}</span>
impossible so to get any peace unless we changed the
address every week, and this would have been decidedly
too expensive.  As it was, he was often followed to the
station by a detective or some private busybody who could
not realize that even a public man may possible prefer to
keep a little of his life to himself.
</p>

<p>
So very many hours I waited for him at various
stations!  The officials (at each and all) were most kind
and considerate to the lonely lady who had to be driven,
by sheer force of regulations, from one waiting-room to
another as the lights were put out, and who finally would
take to a steady tramp up and down the station platform
till at length (such a long length sometimes!) she was
joined by her husband and almost lifted into the hansom-cab
they invariably drove off in.
</p>

<p>
When I felt that he really wanted me to wait I could
not bear to go home, and though Waterloo was the most
uncomfortable station of all to keep vigil in I often chose
it, as, owing to the early morning trains at the Junction,
I could always be sure that it would not be altogether
shut up.
</p>

<p>
I think the officials must have known who Parnell was,
as I always had a free pass (from him) for all these lines,
but they never intruded, and, in spite of my pass, received
and kept his telegrams for me (he often telegraphed from
the little office near the House, in the name "Preston")
with perfect tact.  The porters were very good to me also,
and many a scuttle of coal was recklessly emptied on a
waiting-room fire after hours as "reg'lations 'gainst keepin'
on gas strong, but it will be fairly cheerful like with the
firelight, ma'am."  The railway men are a kindly race,
for I rarely tipped these men.

I arrived here to-night.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I fear I may be detained till rather late to-night, so hope
you will not wait up for me.  I expect to return home about 3.30.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The above is a note, one of very many, sent down to
me at Eltham, so that I should, if I wished, go to bed
before Parnell came home.  I did this only once or twice,
as I fancied I heard him directly I closed my eyes, and
would go down, only to find a dreary blank of disappointment.
So I made him agree to my staying in my sitting-room,
where from the open window I could hear for miles
the regular trotting of the cab-horse bringing him home.
</p>

<p>
He only stipulated that I should not go out along the
roads to meet him at night.  In March, 1887, I thought
my King was looking tired and worried.  There had been
various annoying happenings owing to new reports of his
life at Eltham having been put about.  I had had
unpleasant letters from Willie, and the latter and I were not
now on speaking terms.  With this and his hard work
Parnell was looking fagged and worn.  His health, always
an anxiety to me, seemed to fail, and the languor that grew
upon him frightened me.  I determined that he should
be spared the long cold night-drive down to Eltham, and
suggested his having a house near the House of Commons
to which he could return and get immediate rest after a
night sitting.  He had a little house at Brockley, which he
had taken in the name of "Clement Preston," and furnished,
and here he had a man and wife to look after him.
I had never lived there, but used to drive over to see him
for a short time when it was inexpedient that he should
be at Eltham.  He never liked this house, and hated the
way the people used to hang about to see him go in and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P254"></a>254}</span>
out, "Clement Preston" apparently being but a poor
protection in keeping off curiosity as to Parnell's habits.  He
wearily said he did not want to live in London unless I
would live there too, but, as I pointed out, that was
impossible, and I took a house in York Terrace, Regent's
Park (furnished), for him.  Here I installed him with two
servants, who absolutely worshipped the ground he walked
upon, and, having placed various books about, books that
he considered of pleasant relaxation, such as engineering
and mining treatises, with a couple of Dickens' works that
he had always been "going to read," and a few technical
journals, I went home haunted by his grave, considering
eyes and his sad "You must not leave me here by myself;
I don't want to be here without you!" hoping that
after a day or two he would settle down and feel the benefit
of getting more quickly to bed.
</p>

<p>
The house was charming, with, on one side, a lovely
outlook over Regent's Park.  It was very pretty and
comfortable, and I used to make flying visits to him, to sit with
him while he ate his breakfast.
</p>

<p>
For three weeks I congratulated myself on having been
self-denying enough to earn him better rest, even at the
cost to myself of not having him so much with me; then,
on my return from my aunt, whose great age was now
beginning to tell upon her, late one evening, I felt anxious
and worried about my lover, even though my good-night
telegram was awaiting me.  He always telegraphed
"good-night" if he was away from me.  I tried to shake
the feeling off, but after dinner I found myself mechanically
making up the fire in my sitting-room as I did when
sitting up for Parnell after a late sitting of the House.
I felt amused at my absent-mindedness, and sat down
before the fire, thinking that I would take advantage of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P255"></a>255}</span>
the beautiful blaze I had made.  I sat there idly, thinking
of Parnell, wondering what exactly he was doing at that
moment, and presently, hearing the servants go to bed,
and feeling disinclined for bed myself, I got a book.
</p>

<p>
I could not settle to reading, and began to feel very
lonely and to wish I were really waiting up for Parnell,
as I used to.  I thought of my aunt, of how very old
she was, of her immense goodness to me ever since I had
lived at Eltham, and of what a great blank there would
be when she died&mdash;her life seemed to be like a flame
flickering in the wind now, and it might go out any day.
I got up to shake off my sad thoughts, and, throwing
open my window, leant out and listened to the wind in
the trees.
</p>

<p>
I heard the clock strike two, and listened, as I had
always done, about this time, for the regular beat of the
horse's hoofs that would bring my King home.  I could
hear nothing, and my longing for his presence was so
great that I called out under my breath, "I wish you
would come.  I do wish you would come."  Then I think
I became drowsy, for I started up from the window,
suddenly hearing three o'clock ring out from the village and
the steady trot-trot of a horse in the distance.
</p>

<p>
I held my breath to listen, my heart beating with an
eager joy.  I could hear the beat of the hoofs round the
corner into the village as they came from the Common,
then lost as they went up the High Street, and suddenly
clearer with the jingle of the cab bells as they turned
the top of the road and stopped.  I knew now, and opened
the door quickly as my love came up the little side-walk
past the window, giving the familiar signal as he went
up the two steps; and I was in his arms as he whispered,
"Oh, my love, you must not leave me alone again."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br />
THE PARNELL COMMISSION
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>For none on earth so lone as he<br />
  Whose way of thought is high and free,<br />
  Beyond the mist, beyond the cloud,<br />
  Beyond the clamour of the crowd.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I had long since had a high paling put round my garden
to screen it from the inquisitive eyes of persons who had,
until this was done, the impertinence to lean over the
short stone wall and railings to watch Parnell as he went
in and out.  This new paling was seven feet high.  On
the carriage gates there was bronze ornamental work,
thick and heavy.  Once this was cut through by someone
unknown and fell, the next time the gate was opened, upon
the head of the groom, as he stooped to unbolt it.
</p>

<p>
This little "accident" was no doubt intended for
Mr. Parnell's or for my benefit, and the fact that the young
man's arm was pushed against the gate, above his head,
as he stooped to ease the bolt, doubtless saved him from
a cracked skull.  As it was, he was badly bruised and
cut, some fifty pounds of bronze work falling partly upon
him.  After this he examined the work on the other gate,
and, finding that this also had been cut through, with the
help of the gardener lifted it off before further damage
was done.  This pointless and malignant spite might
easily have had far more serious consequences, since my
children were going out by these gates driving their
ponies, and it was quite by chance that they had called
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P257"></a>257}</span>
the groom to open the gates for them, for one or other
of them generally played at being the "footman" on these
occasions.  The police could not trace the perpetrators of
the little pleasantry.
</p>

<p>
I then made a beautiful, thick rose-hedge at one side
of this garden, and the roses grew and flourished to such
an extent that it proved an effectual screen from the
too-pressing attention of persons, who had not, I suppose,
very many interests of their own.
</p>

<p>
On the morning that the (so-called) Parnell letters
appeared in the <i>Times</i> (March 7, 1887), they were cut out
and pasted on the gate by a person or persons unknown;
and here also the perspicacity of our local police failed
to find the merrymaker.
</p>

<p>
On that day I did not give Parnell the <i>Times</i> opened
as usual for his glance over the political reports while he
breakfasted.  He asked for it, but I wanted him to finish
his breakfast first, and replied: "The <i>Times</i> is unusually
stodgy; do eat your breakfast first."
</p>

<p>
He said he must finish a bit of assaying he had left
over-night before going to London, and would not have
time for papers afterwards, so I told him of the letters,
and propped the <i>Times</i> against the teapot as usual.
</p>

<p>
He read the whole thing; meditatively buttering and
eating his toast the while.  I supplied him with
marmalade, and turned over the folded paper for him so that
he could read more easily.
</p>

<p>
He made no remark at all till he had finished breakfast,
and carefully clipped the end off his cigar; then, with a
smile, he tossed the paper at me, saying, "Now for that
assaying I didn't finish!  Wouldn't you hide your head
with shame if your King were so stupid as that, my
Queen?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P258"></a>258}</span>
</p>

<p>
I helped him to set his chemicals right, urging on him
that the thing was very serious, and that he must attend
to it; but he only replied: "You think about it for me
while I am finishing this.  Now don't spoil this for me.
It will do presently!" and I subsided with the <i>Times</i>
while he worked at his crucibles, and jotted down
results&mdash;absolutely absorbed for more than two hours, and only
brought back to politics by my call of "You absolutely
must start now."
</p>

<p>
He had a wonderful little machine&mdash;a balance that
gave the weight of almost infinitesimal parts of a
grain&mdash;and this might be touched by no one but himself.  He
now reluctantly covered it with its glass case and lovingly
padded it round with a cloth, lest a rough movement in
the room should put it out of balance.
</p>

<p>
I said, "Now, my King, you must attend to the <i>Times</i>.
You must take an action against them."
</p>

<p>
"No.  Why should I?" struggling into his coat as I
held it for him.  "I have never taken any notice of any
newspapers, nor of anyone.  Why should I now?"
</p>

<p>
However, he promised me he would consult the
"Party" about the letters, and left assuring me that the
English <i>Times</i> was a paper of no particular importance,
after all.
</p>

<p>
He got home before I did that evening, and I found
him on my return weighing the infinitesimal specks of
his morning's extraction of gold with the utmost accuracy.
He gave me a smile and the fire-flame of his welcoming
eyes as usual, but murmured, "Don't speak for one
moment; I'll tell you the moment I have finished this,"
and I had to sit with as much patience as I could muster
while he finished his calculations.  Then, coming over to
me in triumph, he informed my for once uninterested ears
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P259"></a>259}</span>
that he had now completed the extraction of something or
other of a grain of the gold for my wedding ring.
</p>

<p>
On my firmly recalling his attention to the matter of
the letters he said wearily&mdash;all the interest and buoyancy
gone&mdash;"They want me to fight it, but it will be a terrible
nuisance, my Queenie; I have seen Lewis, and he is going
to see Russell&mdash;Sir Charles, you know&mdash;and then I am
to see him again."
</p>

<p>
He was very undecided about the necessity of taking
the action against the <i>Times</i>, and more than once pointed
out to me that the opinion of that paper and its readers
did not really interest him; but, on my refusing to accept
this at all, and urging that Ireland required that he should
defend himself in this, and that my view was that of the
Irish Party, he promised to take the matter seriously,
merely remarking with an amused cynicism that if Ireland
wanted him to cudgel a clean bill of health out of England
she would find work for all the blackthorns she grew.
</p>

<p>
Soon my absorbed study of the forged letters caught
Parnell's interest, he shook off his apathy, and joined
my study of his handwriting of many years, and those
of the various possible (and impossible) imitators.  Once
he became interested he threw himself into it as
wholeheartedly as he did into any other hobby.  We spent hours
in this study of calligraphy, and made some interesting
and amusing discoveries.
</p>

<p>
After a couple of interviews with Mr. Lewis and Sir
Charles Russell, Parnell one evening asked me if I would
mind seeing Lewis, as he had expressed a wish to see
me.  I went therefore to Ely Place, and had an interview
with Mr. (Sir George) Lewis.  After we had talked over
the situation he gave me tea, and made an appointment
for another interview in a few days' time.  I put before
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P260"></a>260}</span>
him my various conclusions as to handwritings, one of
which he considered might be useful.
</p>

<p>
We had frequent consultations after this, and, as the
time of the trial drew near, Lewis's offices and the
passages leading to it, with the waiting rooms, were filled
with the witnesses from Ireland concerned in the trial.
The case did not worry Parnell much&mdash;except that it took
up so much of our all too little leisure time, which was
so precious to us.
</p>

<p>
The following letters, written from Avondale during
the anxious time preceding the trial, will serve to show
how little the matter affected his ordinary interests.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
  <i>August</i> 30, 1887.<br />

<p class="letter">
MY OWN WIFIE,&mdash;I have been exceedingly anxious about
you ever since I left.  You seemed so very ill that it has been
haunting me ever since that I ought to have stayed in London.
My own darling may write to me whenever she pleases.
I was so longing for a telegram all day yesterday, but not
getting one came to the conclusion that you had not been able
to go to London.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I have been round the place here, everything going on well.
The new mine is improving, so I have been tempted to continue
it for a short while longer.
</p>

<p class="letter">
It will not be necessary for me to remain here longer than a
few days, so that whenever you are ready for me I can return.
</p>

<p class="letter">

<p class="letter">
I finished will before going to bed on Monday, and will
execute it and send it north to-morrow.  Am pretty sure to be
able to return next Monday or Tuesday at latest.
</p>

<p class="letter">
MY OWN DARLING QUEENIE,&mdash;I got off all right yesterday
morning, forgetting the lamp, however, until I was in train,
when I decided upon telegraphing them from Chester to send
it on at once, which I did.  I am having the carpenter to fix
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P261"></a>261}</span>
a strong hook in the ceiling joist for it to hang upon, and
it will be a great improvement on the present state of affairs,
as the consumption of candles is enormous, while giving very
little light.  They are undoubtedly the best and safest lamps
out; in fact, absolutely safe.
</p>

<p class="letter">
One of the little lamps here was broken since, so I have
suspended the other one also, as it was no use by itself.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The room will be very nice for a large suspended lamp; it
is about 13½ feet high, by 24 feet by 20 feet.

<p>
A couple of weeks before the action came on Parnell
came home in great amusement.  Lewis had written
asking him most particularly to call, as he had had a
consultation with Sir Charles Russell and wished to report
the result to Parnell.  On Parnell's calling, thinking some
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P262"></a>262}</span>
new phase of the case had been evolved, Mr. Lewis had
"hoped he would not be annoyed," but Sir Charles and
he were rather worried about his (Parnell's) clothes, and
would he very much mind having a new frock-coat from
Poole's for the trial!  Parnell had great fun with me over
that Poole coat, and when it came home we tried it on
with great ceremony, Parnell stroking its silk facings with
pride, and insisting upon a back view of it in the long
mirror in my room.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lewis inspired me with the greatest confidence,
and his charmingly deferential manner fascinated me,
while the keen brown eyes seemed to read the hidden
secrets of the soul.  He was always exquisitely dressed,
and, when I made some playful remark about Parnell's
new coat, he told me in confidence that Parnell's Irish
homespuns were a great trial to him&mdash;this with such
earnestness that I tried to suppress my laughter, as
I explained to him what a pleasure it was to me to be
possessed of a man who was above clothes; not below
them in slovenliness, but above them and unconscious
of his coverings.
</p>

<p>
Very many years after this, long after my husband's
death, this acquaintance with Sir George Lewis served
me in good stead.  Circumstances arose which rendered
me very doubtful and uneasy in regard to the probity
of my trustee and solicitor, who had charge of my whole
income and the capital thereof.  I had had no communication
with Sir George Lewis for very many years; but
then the happy thought struck me that he would advise
me privately and disinterestedly.  My son went to him
on my behalf, and it is entirely owing to the prompt
action taken by Sir George that any part of my little
income was saved to me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P263"></a>263}</span>
</p>

<p>
My trustee had been speculating wildly, and, among
that of other clients, every penny of my small fortune
had been misappropriated.  Sir George compelled the
repayment of what was possible by the discredited and
ruined man, and thus saved me by his kind and energetic
intervention from absolute destitution.  Apart from the
very serious loss it entailed upon me, the downfall of my
trustee, clever, good-looking and altogether charming,
was a great blow to us all.  He had been so much a friend,
and I and my son and daughters had trusted him so
completely.
</p>

<p>
The result of the Parnell Commission is well known.
I continued to see Mr. Lewis regularly before the case
came on, and on one occasion he asked me if I would
mind going to Wood's Hotel, close by Ely Place, to meet
him on a matter that had to do with the case.  This I did,
and, being early, awaited him in the coffee room.  When
he came we had a long business talk about the case, and
he assured me that the issue was now completely secured.
People were passing in and out as we talked, and several
I noticed passed very close to us, and stared curiously at
me before going out.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, on observing this, I asked Mr. Lewis why
he had arranged our interview in this place instead of at
his office as usual.  He made some evasive reply about
a client of his who occupied a very distinguished
position&mdash;and he mentioned this personage by name&mdash;having an
appointment at the office, and disliking the fact of any
other person being received during the same hour of his
visit.
</p>

<p>
I pointed out to Mr. Lewis that he was surely speaking
at random, as the person he mentioned could not be
left about at his office like a nobody while he talked to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P264"></a>264}</span>
me at an hotel.  At this he laughed, and asked that I
should be satisfied with his reply until he saw me again,
and with this I had to be content, though I was somewhat
ruffled at his not offering a sufficient explanation of his
odd place of appointment, and I curtly refused to make
another at the office for the following week.
</p>

<p>
Our interview had ostensibly been for the purpose
of discussing certain letters I had given into his care at
a former interview, but, as he afterwards told me, he had
asked those persons, who had, I thought, stared at me
in the hotel, if they could identify me with someone who
had been impersonating me with the hope of better
entangling Parnell, and of preventing him from publicly
protecting his honour for fear of dragging me into the
case.  The "gentlemen from Ireland" who had had so
good a look at me were forced to admit that they had
never seen me before in their lives.
</p>

<p>
Shortly before the case came on I asked Mr. Lewis if
he would mind my going to see Mr. Soames (solicitor for
the <i>Times</i>).  He answered, "I do not see why you should
not do so if you wish it," and to Parnell, who had just
come in, "It will be quite safe for her to see Soames."  "Yes,
of course, she knows best," answered Parnell, and
off I went, pursued by Mr. Lewis's "You must come
straight back here, Mrs. O'Shea," as he put me into the
waiting cab.
</p>

<p>
My waiting cab was always an acute irritation to Lewis.
Alter his first greeting of me he invariably asked me if
my cab was waiting.  "Yes, of course, how else should
get home?"  "You are not going to drive home!" with
horror.  "No, but to the station."  "Pay him off, my dear
lady, and I'll send for another when I have given you
some tea," encouragingly.  "But I <i>like</i> this horse, he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P265"></a>265}</span>
has such good legs."  Then dear Mr. Lewis used to get
intensely irritated, and send someone flying to pay my
cab to go away at once.  I never dared at this stage to
tell him that I always made a compact with the cabman
that "waiting did not count."
</p>

<p>
On my arrival at Mr. Soames's office he saw me at
once without any pretence of being "too busy."  In fact
his office appeared almost deserted, and he welcomed me
as his "cousin."  He took some time in arranging the
exact collateral degree of our relationship, but beyond this
our interview behind his closely shut glass-panelled door
led to nothing.  I was desirous of finding out which way
his suspicions tended&mdash;as obviously he did not really think
that Parnell had written the letters; he, on his part, was
trying to find out why I had come.
</p>

<p>
On the 1st of March, 1889, Pigott shot himself in
Madrid.  It was a painful affair, and Parnell was sorry
for the poor creature.
</p>

<p>
When Parnell attended the House for the first time
after the result of the Parnell Commission was made
known, I was not well, and could not get to the Ladies'
Gallery, as I had hoped to do, but long before he came
I had had reports of the tremendous ovation he received;
how every section of the House&mdash;Ministers, Opposition&mdash;all
rose at his entry as one man, cheering themselves
hoarse and shouting his name.  I asked him afterwards if
he had not felt very proud and happy then, but he only
smiled, and answered, "They would all be at my throat
in a week if they could!"  I thought of that speech a
little later on.
</p>

<p>
Soon after the death of Pigott Mr. Parnell met Mr. and
Mrs. Gladstone at Mrs. Sydney Buxton's[<a id="chap25fn5text"></a><a href="#chap25fn5">5</a>] "at home."
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P266"></a>266}</span>
Almost the only comment, when he got home was:
"That's over; thank goodness!"
</p>

<p>
On May 28th, 1889, Sir Charles and Lady Russell
gave a reception in honour of the hero of the fight.
Parnell hated these affairs, but, as I pointed out to him,
it would be very sad if all those people assembled to meet
him and he was not there.  The reception was a time of
adulation for him from first to last, I afterwards heard,
but when Parnell came home and told me all about it he
remarked, "It was all very kind and just as troublesome
as usual&mdash;or would have been had I not discovered a pretty
little brown head with friendly eyes that looked as shy
as I felt."
</p>

<p>
I answered, "Dear me, who was this charming lady?
I should like to know!"
</p>

<p>
"That is just what she was, a charming little lady, an
Irishwoman.  You know, Queenie, you are the only
Englishwoman I can bear!  This was Katharine Tynan; you
read some of her things to me," and he went on to speak
of others at the reception, afterwards reverting to the
pleasure he had felt in meeting Katharine Tynan, who he
believed genuinely felt what all "those others" were
saying.
</p>

<p>
Presumably "those others" were perfectly sincere in
their appreciation of him, but Parnell, so English in his
own nature, had a constitutional distrust of English
people, and, curiously enough, he did not understand
them well, while the Irish character was an open book to
him.  At a reception like this where the guests were, of
course, mostly English, Parnell would retire behind his
coldest, most aloof bulwark of exquisite courtesy, and, to
use his own simile about Katharine Tynan, "I felt as
though a little friendly bird had made a song for me in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P267"></a>267}</span>
an unfriendly land."  We often afterwards spoke of the
"little friendly bird," and, should Mrs. Hinkson
(Katharine Tynan) ever see this book, she will know that the
"Chief" appreciated both her loyalty and her song.
</p>

<p>
Directly the result of the Parnell Commission was made
known Mr. Parnell was elected a life member of the
National Liberal Club; an election which afforded him a
certain grave amusement at the time and a query later on,
when the "National Liberals" wished to depose him, as
to whether a "life member" can dare be so illogical as
to continue life without the membership.
</p>

<p>
On the 8th March, 1889, he was entertained for the
second time at the Eighty Club, and, a few days later,
at a great meeting at St. James's Hall.  At both meetings
the enthusiasm was so great that the whole body of people
present rose en masse as he entered, cheering, waving
handkerchiefs, and shouting his name for some time before
they allowed him to sit down.
</p>

<p>
Naturally these ovations of my hero gave me the
greatest pride and joy, but he would never allow me to
say much about them.
</p>

<p>
"You see, my dear, these people are not really pleased
with me," he would say.  "They thought I had written
those letters, and now they are extolling their own sense
of justice in cheering me because I did not write them.
I might as wisely shout myself hoarse if a court of law
decided that Gladstone had not told somebody to rob a
bank!"  And I would reply: "Well, I love to hear and
read about your being properly appreciated," only to get
a reproving "You are an illogical woman.  These people
do not appreciate me, they only howl with joy because I
have been found within the law.  The English make a law
and bow down and worship it till they find it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P268"></a>268}</span>
obsolete&mdash;long after this is obvious to other nations&mdash;then they
bravely make another, and start afresh in the opposite
direction.  That's why I am glad Ireland has a religion;
there is so little hope for a nation that worships laws."
</p>

<p>
And when I persisted, "But don't you feel a little
excited and proud when they all cheer you, really you?"
and the little flames showed in his eyes as he said, "Yes,
when it is really me, when I am in the midst of a peasant
crowd in Ireland.  Then I feel a little as I do when I see
you smile across the street at me before we meet, but for
these others it is then I know how I hate the English, and
it is then, if I begin to feel a little bit elated, I remember
the howling of the mob I once saw chasing a man to lynch
him years ago.  Don't be too pleased with the clapping
of these law-lovers, Queenie.  I have a presentiment that
you will hear them another way before long, and I am
exactly the same, either way!"
</p>

<p>
At the National Liberal Club, at which Sir Frank
Lockwood presided, Mr. Parnell and Lord Spencer shook
hands for the first time.  When Parnell rose to speak he
received a perfect ovation.  He said:
</p>

<p>
"There is only one way in which you can govern
Ireland within the Constitution, and that is by allowing
her to govern herself in all those matters which cannot
interfere with the greatness and well-being of the Empire
of which she forms a part.  I admit there is another way.
That is a way that has not been tried yet....  There is
a way in which you might obtain at all events some present
success in the government of Ireland.  It is not Mr. Balfour's
bastard plan of a semi-constitutional, a semi-coercive
method.  You might find among yourselves some great
Englishman or Scotsman, who would go over to Ireland&mdash;her
Parliamentary representation having been taken away
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P269"></a>269}</span>
from her&mdash;and would do justice to her people notwithstanding
the complaints of Irish landlordism.  Such a
man might be found who, on the other hand, would oppose
a stern front to the inciters of revolution or outrage, and
on the other hand would check the exorbitant demands of
the governing classes in that country, and perhaps the
result might be successful.  But it would have to be a
method outside the Constitution both on the one side and
on the other.  Your Irish Governor would have to have
full power to check the evil-doer; whether the evil-doer
were a lord or a peasant, whether the malefactor hailed
from Westminster or New York, the power should be
equally exercised and constantly maintained.  In that way,
perhaps, as I have said, you might govern Ireland for a
season.  That, in my judgment, from the first time when
I entered political life, appeared to me to be the only
alternative to the concession to Ireland of full power over
her own domestic interests, and her future.  In one way
only, I also saw, could the power and influence of a
constitutional party be banded together within the limits of
the law; by acting on those principles laid down by Lucas
and Gavan Duffy in 1852, that they should hold themselves
aloof from all English political parties and combinations,
that they should refuse place and office for themselves or
for their friends or their relations, and that the Irish
constituencies should refuse to return any member who was
a traitor to those pledges."
</p>

<p>
In July Parnell was presented with the freedom of the
City of Edinburgh.  In his speech of acknowledgment
he said:
</p>

<p>
"In what way could Ireland, supposing she wished to
injure you, be more powerful to effect injury to your
Imperial interests than she is at present?  If you concede
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P270"></a>270}</span>
to her people the power to work out their own future,
to make themselves happy and prosperous, how do you
make yourselves weaker to withstand wrongdoing against
yourselves?  Will not your physical capacity be the same
as it is now?  Will you not still have your troops in the
country?  Will you not still have all the power of the
Empire? ... In what way do we make you weaker?  In
what way shall we be stronger to injure you?  What
soldiers shall we have?  What armed policemen shall we
have?  What cannons shall we have?  What single means
shall we have, beyond the constitution, that we have not
now, to work you injury?"[<a id="chap25fn6text"></a><a href="#chap25fn6">6</a>]

[<a href="#chap25fn6text">6</a>] A letter of this period from Parnell to Cecil Rhodes,
dealing with the
Imperial aspect of Home Rule, is unfortunately the only important
document left of the correspondence between the two,
the rest having been
accidentally destroyed.  Parnell had been greatly
interested in the political
tactics of Rhodes in South Africa.
When in London Rhodes sought an
interview, which took place at the Westminster Palace Hotel.
In the letter
of June 23, 1888, Parnell expresses his gladness
at knowing that Rhodes
considers that the measure of Home Rule
to be granted to Ireland should
be "thoroughgoing," and adds:
"I cordially agree with your opinion
that there should be effective safeguards
for the maintenance of Imperial
unity."  The two men had been discussing
the question of the exclusion
or inclusion of Irish representation at Westminster.
Parnell judged
exclusion to have been a defect of the Bill of 1886,
and shared Rhodes's
view that inclusion would facilitate the larger measure of Imperial
federation.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
Parnell returned to this point in 1891
in the course of his correspondence
with Dillon and O'Brien on the question
of the leadership of the Nationalist
Party.  He asserted in a letter to Gill,
one of the intermediaries in these
discussions, that he could prove
"by documentary evidence" that the
second reading of the 1886 Bill was lost
"because the Liberal leaders
declined till too late to agree to the retention
of any Irish Members in any
shape or for any purpose."

BRIGHTON HAUNTS

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;HONORA SHEE (THE LOVER'S DIARY).<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
My aunt appeared to me to be failing in health a good
deal at the beginning of 1888, and, though she sometimes
seemed to be stronger, and chatted with all her old
interest in the things of the past, there were days when
she was so quiet and drowsy that I feared to rouse her
by talking.  At other times she would like me to talk and
read to her as usual, but was so languid and tired that
a little smile and pressure of the hand I held was the only
response she made.  In April she had a slight attack of
bronchitis, and her doctor ordered her opium to ease her
lungs.  She much objected to all opiates, but her doctor's
treatment seemed to ease her.  She would not let me sleep
in her house, as she thought, as usual, that it would
"disorganize the household," but I went now nearly every
night across the park in the fragrant spring nights to
inquire, under her maid's window, if Mrs. "Ben" was
asleep.
</p>

<p>
The owls had nested for years in a great tree by my
aunt's bedroom windows, and I loved to watch them in
the moonlight hawking for the food they had to supply in
such abundance now to the screeching owlets in the nest.
The old birds used to sit on Aunt Ben's window-sill, and
hoot, and had done so, much to her pleasure, for the sixty
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P272"></a>272}</span>
or seventy years of her residence in the house; but now
her maid shook her head sadly, as she leant out of the
window to tell me of her mistress's condition, saying
"That's an omen, m'am; the dear mistress must be going
soon."  I answered irritably that the owls had hooted there
since Mr. Benjamin's time, as her mistress had often told
her, but felt her "Time will show, m'am," to be
unanswerable.
</p>

<p>
On these May nights, if he was at home, Parnell would
walk across the park with me and wait on a seat for me
till I had obtained the latest bulletin.
</p>

<p>
One morning, very early, when her night had been
restless, I made Mary Ann (my aunt's personal maid)
come down and let me in.  On going up to the great
four-post bed where the dear little old lady lay, looking as
small and frail as a child, she put out one, now feeble,
white hand, and held mine.  I told the maid she could go
and rest a bit, and I would call her if my aunt wanted her.
</p>

<p>
When she was gone, my aunt, who was breathing with
difficulty, whispered as I bent down to kiss her hand,
"You do believe, do you not, my Swan?" I answered,
"Yes, auntie, of course I do believe, most firmly."  She
said, "I am glad.  I wish you could come with me, my
darling!" and I sobbingly told her that I wished I could
too.
</p>

<p>
I stayed by her side and smoothed her hand till she
ceased to breathe, and then waited by her as all her
servants who had been with her for many years filed past the
bed, and took a last look at their stern but just and
much-loved mistress.
</p>

<p>
She left a great void in my life, and the sensation of
being always wanted and tied to one place that I had
sometimes felt so keenly hard I would now have given
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P273"></a>273}</span>
much to feel again.  With this old lady died, so far as
my acquaintance went, the last of the old world&mdash;that old
world of leisure and books and gentle courtesy of days
when men might wear their gallantry without foolishness,
and women knew the value of their sex.
</p>

<p>
Through all those years in which I waited on my aunt
I never heard her use a clipped word, or use a sentence not
grammatically perfect and beautifully rounded off, and
although in the hurry of modern life I sometimes felt
impatient when chided for some swallowed pronunciation
or ignored g's, I look back upon the years of my life spent
in that old-world atmosphere as a very precious memory.
</p>

<p>
After my aunt's death Eltham became intolerable to
me, and I took a small country house near Mottingham
till I could let my own house.  Directly we left Eltham the
pretty garden was devastated by relic-hunters, who pulled
the place to pieces in obtaining mementoes of "the house
where Parnell had lived."
</p>

<p>
The house at Mottingham was damp, and we longed
for the sea.
</p>

<p>
For various reasons we had been obliged to relinquish
any idea of living in the little house we had finished, with so
much pleasure, at Eastbourne, and at last we had removed
the few things we had stored there, and in 1887 had finally
decided to take the end house of Walsingham Terrace
(No. 10), Brighton.  Shortly after my aunt's death we
went down to live there.  The position then was attractive
to us: cornfields from one side of the house away up to
Shoreham basin and harbour, a waste of hay at the back
of the house, an excellent train service and a sufficient
distance from Brighton proper to enable us to avoid the
crowd.  While we were living there people used to walk
and drive out to see "Parnell's house," but this was not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P274"></a>274}</span>
particularly annoying, as when he was at home we went
out early, or late&mdash;anyhow, at a time when the average
person is kept at home by appetite.  Personally, if it was
not glaringly inconvenient, I was always rather proud
and interested in the popular attention Parnell attracted
wherever he went.
</p>

<p>
Here Parnell had the dining-room as his own sitting-room,
where he kept the roll-top desk I had given him
for all his papers and political work, while down in the
basement there was a room in which he had a furnace
fitted up, and where we used to burn the crushed ore
before assaying it.  We spent many hours down there,
and I sometimes feared the excessive heat must have been
bad for him; but he did not think so, and would become
so absorbed in this work that I used to have the greatest
difficulty in getting him out for the gallop on his horse
President across the Downs, which did him so much good.
</p>

<p>
I found at length the only way was to get his cap and
whip and show them to the dogs.  Immediately I did this
they would begin to bark wildly and jump up at him to
make him start for the run they loved so much.  Parnell
would then say reproachfully, "Oh, Queenie, how can you
deceive the poor dogs like that?" and I would answer
that the only way to keep them believing in us was to go
at once for that belated ride.  Once started none of the
party, dogs or horses, enjoyed it more than he.
</p>

<p>
In this house we had from the side windows of Parnell's
and from my room in which he afterwards died, a
view of the most wonderful sunsets I have ever seen in
England.  Then the whole west was a veritable fairyland
of gold and crimson, and the harbour and Shoreham town,
with the little country church of Aldrington against the
setting of the Downs, were touched with a pearly mist of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P275"></a>275}</span>
light that lifted them far out of the prosaic ugliness we
knew by the blank light of midday.  Parnell used to say to
me as we walked away to the golden harbour, "Is it really
like this, my Queen, or as we see it at noon?"  I could
only reply that it was both&mdash;the both that made life at
once so interesting and so difficult.
</p>

<p>
Often in the following spring my King and I would
drive out as far as the foot of the Downs near the training
stables beyond Southwick; and then, climbing to the crest
of the hills, go for long walks, away over the Downs,
walking or resting as we felt inclined, returning as night
fell, to drive home.
</p>

<p>
One sunny morning, lengthening into a brighter day,
I especially remember, when the south-west wind sent the
flickering shadows across the Downs where its sea-scents
mingled with the sweet pungency of the young herbage.
As we walked along hand in hand we were gay in the
glorious spring of the year, feeling that while love walked
so closely with us youth could not lag too far behind, and
in the wide expanse of the South Downs, which appealed
so much to both our natures, we forgot all care and trouble.
</p>

<p>
Very far away, standing clear against the skyline, there
was a figure of a shepherd, his flock a little lower showed
grey against the dull green distance.  He stood
motionless, as these lonely Down shepherds do.  The tumbled
heap by him, we said, was his dog.  So we watched him
some miles away for more than an hour.  We wondered
what he thought of, and whether all this lonely loveliness
meant anything to him, or if he would be glad to change
his quiet life for the rush and hurry of a town.
</p>

<p>
Presently, from where we sat, at the highest point of
the hills, we saw some horses going at full gallop over the
training ground, the horses straining at the bit, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P276"></a>276}</span>
seemingly glad to be alive.  The dull thud of the hoofs came
up to us to mingle with the incessant trilling of the
skylarks and the bleating of the distant sheep.  Now we
turned seaward, overlooking Shoreham Harbour, and
watched the vessels going out to sea on voyages fraught
with unknown possibilities.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the excessive beauty of the scene, in the
region of thought it had a saddening effect on us; and, as
the last gleams of sunlight fell across the sea, lightly
touching the sails as they slipped out of the light into the wider
darkness of the leaden waves, we turned and retraced our
steps, I leaning on his arm as we went down to the valley
again.
</p>

<p>
A favourite haunt of ours at Brighton was a little
shop in Pool Valley altogether devoted to the sale of
pebbles and crystals of various sorts, also of jet.  Parnell
did not like the jet, but was greatly interested in the
pebbles and the polishing of them.
</p>

<p>
He spent much time after we had found this shop in
watching the process of cutting crystals and polishing the
pebbles.  Onyx ball beads he selected in sizes with the
greatest care, and had a long chain of them made for me
with a gold ball between each two onyx beads.  To these
he had added a locket composed of crystal and onyx, and
was much pleased with the result.
</p>

<p>
The chain, when finished, was a little heavy, but he
had had such a happy time in selecting each bead and
so carefully matching the markings that I wore it with a
light heart till he noticed it was rubbing my neck, and
insisted upon my taking it off there and then for ever.
</p>

<p>
Another favourite haunt of ours was Smith's second-hand
bookshop in North Street, where he would stand
for an hour at a time poring over old books on mechanics,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P277"></a>277}</span>
or mining, while I dug out "bargains" amongst the poets
of a bygone age, and discussed books with the proprietor.
</p>

<p>
Parnell always tried to get a few days' shooting every
year in Ireland on the grouse moors he hired at
Anghavanagh, and I had much pleasure in getting together
hampers of provisions for him in London to take over
with him, as the arrangements he had been used to before
I met him were decidedly primitive and very trying to
his health.  I always found that a good supply of hams
and tongues, with the very best tea that I could procure,
a new spirit kettle (every year) and a goodly supply of
rugs and blankets rendered him sufficiently comfortable,
and returned him to me without the acute attacks of
indigestion that had formerly rendered these holidays among
the mountains so little gain to him in health.
</p>

<p>
I had to insist upon his learning to make his own tea
to save him from the "stewed" tea made by his servant
in Ireland, and I found it better to label the tea I got for
his personal use: "For presents," and that which he
might give away: "For Mr. Parnell's own use," as he
said plaintively, "They seem to like my tea best!"
</p>

<p>
He used to love these shooting expeditions, but would
never stay more than a few days, as he could not bear to
be away from me longer.  I used to wish it were possible
for me to go to Ireland with him in order that he might
enjoy his shooting to the full, but that was impossible,
and he always declared that "Three or four days broke
the back of that little shoot, anyhow!"
</p>

<p>
For many months Parnell tried to invent a vessel which
would so cut through the water as to obviate any sensation
of the motion of the waves.  When he had done this
the ship was to be built, and I would be enabled to cross
the Atlantic as comfortably as I now made the journey
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P278"></a>278}</span>
to Brighton!  Incidentally this invention was also to
make our fortunes.  Although the building of the ship had
to be indefinitely postponed, the models made and tested
by Parnell were really wonderful.  He had had no training
in mechanics, nor did he know anything of shipbuilding
or engineering, except such information as he obtained
from the various books he read for amusement at rare
intervals&mdash;but these models he made, and tried off the
underdeck of the Chain Pier at Brighton, were
extraordinarily ingenious.
</p>

<p>
I do not venture to record this on my own authority,
for I know absolutely nothing of such matters, but the
firm, who cast the copper "floats" for him from his plans,
and continually altered and corrected the models after
trials, came to the conclusion that Mr. "Smith" was on
the verge of a very useful invention; though, to his
annoyance, they would not dissociate the torpedo-like structure
from Portsmouth and the Admiralty.  I frequently took
my children down to Brighton for a few days' change, and
on these occasions Mr. Parnell would stay at a place near
the Chain Pier, and we would spend most of the day on
the underdeck of the pier-head trying the "invention."
</p>

<p>
Once a hobby like this got hold of him he could think
of nothing else in his leisure time, and this note is a
specimen of many sent round from his hotel:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p class="letter">
Am making new float, which will sink five feet, and shall
have it ready to try to-morrow at 12.30.  Will meet you on
Chain Pier at that hour.  Am anxious to make this trial before
returning, and we will take Hassocks and Burgess Hill in
afternoon on way back to look at houses to let.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This new model we tried in all weathers, and, as at
last it seemed to answer perfectly, with the exception of
its lack of speed, he said he would patent it, and get
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P279"></a>279}</span>
someone who had more knowledge than he to overcome the
speed difficulty.  To my uninitiated mind the thing looked
like a treble torpedo-boat.  Had he lived I think he would
have gone further into the matter, but, by the time this
was finished, one thing after another occurred with such
rapidity that it was perforce laid aside.
</p>

<p>
I remember one rough, stormy day when we had been
much worried and were wondering whether the time of
waiting we had imposed upon ourselves (that Ireland
might not risk the leadership which seemed her only hope)
till the way could be opened to our complete union before
the world, was not to be too long for our endurance.  It
was a wild storm, and Parnell had to hold me as we slowly
beat our way to the pier-head.  The chains were up to
prevent anyone going on to the lower deck, but Parnell
lifted me over, and we tried the "float," though it was
useless to do so, as the waves shattered the slight thing
against the pier before Parnell could sink it to the required
depth.
</p>

<p>
Then we stood looking out at the great waves&mdash;so near,
and shaking the whole pier-head in their surge.  Parnell
remarked that the old place could not last long, and as I
turned to get a fresh hold on him, for I could not stand
against the wind, and the motion of the sea sickened me,
the blazing fires in his eyes leapt to mine, and, crushing
me roughly to himself, he picked me up and held me clear
over the sea, saying, "Oh, my wife, my wife, I believe
I'll jump in with you, and we shall be free for ever."
</p>

<p>
Had I shown any fear I think he would have done it,
but I only held him tight and said: "As you will, my
only love, but the children?"  He turned then, and carried
me to the upper deck, hiding my eyes from the horrible
roll and sucking of the sea beneath our feet.

CHAPTER XXVII
<br />
THE DIVORCE CASE [<a id="chap27fn1text"></a><a href="#chap27fn1">1</a>]
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>Papel y tinta y poca justicia.</i>"<br />
  ("<i>Paper, ink, and a little justice.</i>")<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;OLD SPANISH PROVERB.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In November, 1890, Parnell was served with a copy of
the petition in the divorce case, O'Shea <i>v.</i> O'Shea and
Parnell, by Wontner at Messrs. Lewis and Lewis's.  I
was served with the petition in the same month at 10,
Walsingham Terrace, Brighton.  Mr. George Lewis and
his confidential clerk came down, and took some evidence
for the case from me, but Parnell declined to instruct any
solicitor from the first to last.  He, however, accompanied
me when I went to town to consult Sir Frank Lockwood,
my counsel, a junior counsel being also present.
</p>

<p>
"The consultation broke up in peals of laughter," said
one of the less important of the evening papers of the time.
This was quite true, but it had no bearing on the case at
all, for the laughter was caused by the extremely funny
stories told us, in his own inimitable way, by Sir Frank
Lockwood.  The two or three times I saw him stand out
in my memory as hours of brilliant wit and nonsense,
that cheered and invigorated us far more than the advice
we did not ask for could have done.  Parnell would not
fight the case, and I could not fight it without him.  The
last time I saw Sir Frank Lockwood, the day before the
case came on, he begged me to get Parnell to let him fight
it.  I was suffering acutely from neuralgic headache at the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P281"></a>281}</span>
time, but I did my best to get Parnell to defend the case,
though to no purpose.
</p>

<p>
We left Sir Frank Lockwood with a promise to telegraph
to him by eight o'clock the next morning if we would
go up and appear in Court at all, as he had to be there
by ten o'clock.
</p>

<p>
We had to return to Brighton in the Pullman car, as
we could not get a carriage to ourselves.  It was crowded,
and Parnell was known; it was therefore very difficult to
talk without being overheard.  Parnell appeared absolutely
unconscious of the eyes furtively watching him from behind
every newspaper, or, indeed, openly in the carriage, and
he had the power of putting himself absolutely beyond and
above self-consciousness.  This is what rendered him so
completely impervious to criticism.  But to me, with a
splitting headache, the gleam of so many eyes, seen
through a mist of pain, had the most uncanny effect.  They
seemed like animals watching from their lair.  Parnell
gave me a cheerful little smile now and then, and directly
we got home he insisted upon my going to bed.  There he
fed me himself with the tiny amount I forced myself to
take to please him, and held the glass to my lips while I
sipped the sparkling Moselle I had been ordered to take
for the bad attacks of neuralgia.
</p>

<p>
After he had had his own dinner he came up and
smoked by my bedside.  I tried to persuade him to go up
with me in the morning to the Court and make some fight
in the case, but he said:
</p>

<p>
"No, Queenie.  What's the use?  We want the divorce,
and, divorce or not, I shall always come where you are.
I shall always come to my home every night whatever
happens.  Now I'm going to read you to sleep."
</p>

<p>
He was always the most gentle and tender of nurses,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P282"></a>282}</span>
and would sit by my side for hours without moving when
I was ill, reading or thinking.  After a short sleep I lay
awake wondering what it would be best to say to Lockwood
in the morning.  I had told him that anyhow I would
go up; but, as my lover said, what would be the use of it?
And whatever I could make of Captain O'Shea's desertion&mdash;or
practical desertion&mdash;of me, I knew absolutely nothing
of his private life, and cared less.  Our position would be
worse if we were not enabled to marry, for we were
inseparable while life lasted.
</p>

<p>
Then, after going over the pros and cons till my brain
felt on fire, I said irritably, "I don't believe you are
listening to what I say!"  He replied, "I am not, beloved; here
is the telegram all written out for you while you slept.  We
have been longing for this freedom all these years, and
now you are afraid!"
</p>

<p>
I broke down and cried, because I feared for him and
for his work, and he soothed me as one would a child as
he told me that his life-work was Ireland's always, but
that his heart and his soul were mine to keep for
ever&mdash;since first he looked into my eyes that summer morning,
ten years before.
</p>

<p>
"Queenie," he went on, "put away all fear and regret
for my public life.  I have given, and will give, Ireland
what is in me to give.  That I have vowed to her, but my
private life shall never belong to any country, but to one
woman.  There will be a howl, but it will be the howl of
hypocrites; not altogether, for some of these Irish fools
are genuine in their belief that forms and creeds can
govern life and men; perhaps they are right so far as they
can experience life.  But I am not as they, for they are
among the world's children.  I am a man, and I have told
these children what they want, and they clamour for it.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P283"></a>283}</span>
If they will let me, I will get it for them.  But if they turn
from me, my Queen, it matters not at all in the end.  What
the ultimate government of Ireland will be is settled, and
it will be so, and what my share in the work has been and
is to be, also.  I do wish you would stop fretting about
me.  We know nothing of how or why, but only that we
love one another, and that through all the ages is the one
fact that cannot be forgotten nor put aside by us."
</p>

<p>
He spoke slowly, with many silences between sentence
and sentence, and presently I said: "But perhaps I have
hurt your work."
</p>

<p>
"No, you have not.  I sometimes think that is why
you came to me, for I was very ill then and you kept the
life in me and the will to go on when I was very weary of
it all; you have stood to me for comfort and strength and
my very life.  I have never been able to feel in the least
sorry for having come into your life.  It had to be, and
the bad times I have caused you and the stones that have
been flung and that will be flung at you are all no matter,
because to us there is no one else in all the world that
matters at all&mdash;when you get to the bottom of things."
</p>

<p>
Late next morning I awoke from the deep sleep of
exhaustion to find him sitting by me superintending the
arrangement of "letters, tea and toast," and to my anxious
query as to the time I was answered by his quiet laugh,
and "I've done you this time, Queenie; I sent the telegram
long ago, and they must be enjoying themselves in Court
by now!"
</p>

<p>
That was Saturday, November 15th, and on Monday,
the 17th, my Brighton solicitor brought me down a copy
of the "decree nisi."  We were very happy that evening,
and Parnell declared he would have the "decree" framed.
We made many plans for the future that evening of where
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P284"></a>284}</span>
we should go when the six months had passed and the
decree made absolute.  I even ventured to suggest that he
might marry someone else once I was set completely free,
but my lover was not amused and scolded me for
suggesting such disgusting ideas.
</p>

<p>
Sir Frank Lockwood was terribly distressed about us
and his inability to "save Parnell for his country," but
he was very kind to me, and did all he could to help me
in certain legal matters.
</p>

<p>
On November 26th there was a meeting of the Irish
Party, which my King attended.  The meeting was
adjourned until December 1st.  When my lover came
home to me that evening I would not let him speak till he
had changed his cold boots and socks; then he came over
to me, and took me into his arms, saying, "I think we
shall have to fight, Queenie.  Can you bear it?  I'm afraid
it is going to be tough work."
</p>

<p>
I said, "Yes, if you can."  But I must confess that
when I looked at the frail figure and white face that was
so painfully delicate, whose only vitality seemed to lie in
the deep, burning eyes, my heart misgave me for I very
much doubted if his health would stand any prolonged
strain.
</p>

<p>
I burst out passionately, "Why does it matter more
now?  They have all known for years," and his rare, low
laugh came out with genuine amusement as he replied,
"My sweetheart, they are afraid of shocking Mr. Gladstone."
</p>

<p>
"But Gladstone&mdash;&mdash;" I began, bewildered.
</p>

<p>
"Just so, but we are public reprobates now, it just
makes the difference.  He is a 'devout Christian,' they
tell me."
</p>

<p>
While Parnell sat down at work at his manifesto I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P285"></a>285}</span>
deliberated for hours as to whether I ought to let him
go on.  Should I urge him to come abroad with me?
I knew he would come if I said I could not bear the public
fight.  I looked at him as he sat now absolutely absorbed
in what he was writing, and now looking across at me
when he had something ready to be pinned together.  He
did not speak, only the smoulder in his eyes grew deeper
as he wrote.
</p>

<p>
I loved him so much, and I did so long to take him
away from all the ingratitude and trouble&mdash;to some sunny
land where we could forget the world and be forgotten.
But then I knew that he would not forget; that he would
come at my bidding, but that his desertion of Ireland would
lie at his heart; that if he was to be happy he must fight
to the end.  I knew him too well to dare to take him away
from the cause he had made his life-work; that even if it
killed him I must let him fight&mdash;fight to the end&mdash;it was
himself&mdash;the great self that I loved, and that I would not
spoil even through my love, though it might bring the
end in death.
</p>

<p>
I looked up feeling that he was watching me, and met
the burning fire-flame of his eyes steadily, through my
tears, as he said, closing his hand over mine, "I am feeling
very ill, Queenie, but I think I shall win through.  I
shall never give in unless you make me, and I want you
to promise me that you will never make me less than the
man you have known."  I promised it.
</p>

<p>
He was feeling very ill.  November was always a bad
month for his health, and the cold and damp gave him
rheumatism.  His left arm pained him almost continuously
all this winter.  I used to rub it and his shoulder with
firwood oil, in which he had great belief, and pack his arm
in wool, which seemed to be some relief.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P286"></a>286}</span>
</p>

<p>
On Saturday morning, November 29th, his manifesto
appeared in all the papers.[<a id="chap27fn2text"></a><a href="#chap27fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p>
War was now declared, and the first battle was fought
in Committee Room 15, where all the miserable treachery
of Parnell's followers&mdash;and others&mdash;was exposed.  The
Grand Old Man had spoken, and his mandate must be
obeyed.  Ever swift to take advantage of a political
opportunity, he struck at the right moment, remorselessly, for
he knew that without giving away the whole of his policy
Parnell could not point to the hypocrisy of a religious
scruple so suddenly afflicting a great statesman at the
eleventh hour.  For ten years Gladstone had known of the
relations between Parnell and myself, and had taken full
advantage of the facility this intimacy offered him in
keeping in touch with the Irish leader.  For ten years.  But
that was a private knowledge.  Now it was a public
knowledge, and an English statesman must always appear on
the side of the angels.
</p>

<p>
So Mr. Gladstone found his religion could at last be
useful to his country.  Parnell felt no resentment towards
Gladstone.  He merely said to me, with his grave smile:
"That old Spider has nearly all my flies in his web," and,
to my indignation against Gladstone he replied: "You
don't make allowances for statecraft.  He has the
Non-conformist conscience to consider, and you know as well
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P287"></a>287}</span>
as I do that he always loathed me.  But these fools, who
throw me over at his bidding, make me a little sad."  And
I thought of that old eagle face, with the cruel eyes that
always belied the smile he gave me, and wondered no
longer at the premonition of disaster that I had so often
felt in his presence.
</p>

<p>
For the Irish Party I have never felt anything but
pity&mdash;pity that they were not worthy of the man and the
opportunity, and, seeing the punishment that the years have
brought upon Ireland, that their craven hearts could not
be loyal to her greatest son.  I have wondered at the
blindness of her mistress, England; wondered that England
should still hold out the reward of Home Rule to Ireland,
whose sons can fight even, it is said, their brothers, but
who fight as children, unknowing and unmeaning, without
the knowledge of a cause and without idea of loyalty.
</p>

<p>
How long the Irish Party had known of the relations
between Parnell and myself need not be here discussed.
Some years before certain members of the Party opened
one of my letters to Parnell.  I make no comment.
</p>

<p>
Parnell very seldom mentioned them.  His outlook was
so much wider than is generally understood and his
comment on members of the Party was always, both before
and after the split, calm, considerate, and as being
impersonal to himself.
</p>

<p>
He regarded the Catholic Church's attitude towards
him as being the logical outcome of her profession.  He
was not, even in the last months, when the priests' veto
to their people turned the fight against him in Ireland,
bitter against them, even though I was.  His strongest
comment was:&mdash;"They have to obey their bishops, and
they Rome&mdash;and that's why the whole system of their
interference in politics is so infernal!"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P288"></a>288}</span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gladstone sent the following letter to Mr. Morley
on November 24th:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
... While clinging to the hope of communication from
Mr. Parnell to whomsoever addressed, I thought it necessary,
viewing the arrangements for the commencement of the Session
to-morrow, to acquaint Mr. McCarthy with the conclusion at
which, after using all the means of observation and reflection
in my power, I had myself arrived.  It was that, notwithstanding
the splendid services rendered by Mr. Parnell to his
country, his continuance at the present moment in the
leadership would be productive of consequences disastrous in the
highest degree to the cause of Ireland.
</p>

<p>
I think I may be warranted in asking you so far to expand
the conclusion I have given above as to add that the
continuance I speak of would not only place many hearty and
effective friends of the Irish cause in a position of great
embarrassment, but would render my retention of the leadership of
the Liberal Party, based as it has been mainly upon the
presentation of the Irish cause, almost a nullity.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Thus Mr. Gladstone signed the death-warrant of Home
Rule for Ireland.
</p>

<p>
On November 18th, 1890, there was a meeting of the
National League in Dublin.  On the same day the
following paragraph appeared in the London letter of the
<i>Freeman's Journal</i>:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"I have direct authority for stating that Mr. Parnell has
not the remotest intention of abandoning either permanently
or temporarily his position or his duties as leader of the Irish
Parliamentary Party.  This may be implicitly accepted as
Mr. Parnell's firm resolution, and perhaps by learning it in
time the Pigottist Press may be spared the humiliation of
indulging in a prolonged outburst of useless vilification.  In
arriving at this determination, I need not say that Mr. Parnell
is actuated exclusively by a sense of his responsibility to the
Irish people, by whose suffrages he holds his public position,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P289"></a>289}</span>
and who alone have the power or the right to influence his
public action.  The wild, unscrupulous, and insincere shriekings
of the Pigottists on the platform and in the Press can
and will do nothing to alter Mr. Parnell's resolve."

<p class="letter">
MY DEAR WILLIE,&mdash;Thanks very much for your kind letter,

<p>
To all his brothers and sisters, and, most of all, to
his mother, Parnell was most generous and affectionate,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P290"></a>290}</span>
and of that generosity and affectionate regard I have
abundant proof.
</p>

<p>
One of the last letters he wrote was to his mother:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
I am weary, dear mother, of these troubles, weary unto
death; but it is all in a good cause.  With health and the
assistance of my friends I am confident of the result.  The
statements my enemies have so often made regarding my
relations with you are on a par with the endless calumnies
they shoot upon me from behind every bush.  Let them pass.
They will die of their own venom.  It would indeed be
dignifying them to notice their existence!
</p>

<p class="t3">
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
NOTE.&mdash;Mrs. Parnell preserved a long series of letters from
Captain O'Shea, dating from 1882 to 1891.  The earlier ones
are mainly concerned with tactical political movements, the
most important of which are the conversations between O'Shea
and Chamberlain, noted on page 197.  Those of the 1885 period
deal chiefly with O'Shea's grievance against Parnell in
connexion with the Clare election.  In one he complains of the
"absolute baseness" of Parnell's conduct.  To all who spoke
to him of it he says, "I replied, 'Poor devil, he is obliged to
allow himself to be kicked to the right or the left and look
pleasant.  But he has the consolation of having been well paid
for the pain&mdash;£40,000, the tribute of the priests and people of
Ireland!'"  The reference was to the great Irish subscription,
headed by the Archbishop of Cashel, made in order to enable
Parnell to clear his estates from the mortgages which oppressed
them.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The later letters, from the end of 1886 onwards, reveal the
violent strain in the relations of Captain and Mrs. O'Shea.
Beginning with a private letter to Mr. Stead, objecting to a
statement in <i>The Pall Mall Gazette</i> that Parnell was staying
on a visit with him, O'Shea went on to write to his wife's
solicitor, Mr. H. Pym, suggesting that she should, for her
children's sake, "declare her renunciation of communication
with" Parnell, and then consulted Chamberlain on his difficulties.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Finally, as a Catholic, he turned to Cardinal Manning for
advice.  His first interview with the head of the Roman Catholic
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P291"></a>291}</span>
Church in England was on October 19th, 1889, when the
question of separation as against divorce was discussed.  A
long correspondence followed.  Manning was reluctant to agree
to the proceedings for divorce, and delayed his decision till
December 4th, when he laid down the course to be pursued,
viz., (1) to collect all evidence in writing; (2) to lay it before
the Bishop of the Diocese and ask for trial; (3) the latter would
appoint a day for hearing; (4) judgment having been given,
the case would go to Rome with a full report of the proceedings.
O'Shea had already become impatient, and when, in another
interview, Manning described to him the constitution of the
Ecclesiastical Court which would report to Rome, he declared
that he hesitated to approach a tribunal not having the right
to administer the oath, and respectfully intimated his intention
to take the case into the English Divorce Court.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The letters close in 1891 with a correspondence between
Captain O Shea and the Primate of Ireland in which the former
repudiates a suggestion made by the Bishop of Galway
(Dr. MacCormack) in February of that year that "in 1886 after
having failed to foist Captain O'Shea upon a neighbouring
county, the then leader had the effrontery of prostituting the
Galway City constituency as a hush gift to O'Shea."  Describing
this as a "grotesquely false" libel, Captain O'Shea details
the course of events before the election, his refusal to take the
Nationalist pledge, and his support by the then Bishop of
Galway (Dr. Carr) and his clergy.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Mr. Healy, in a speech at Kilkenny, had made an attack on
Captain O'Shea on the same lines.  O'Shea was defended by
Lord Stalbridge (formerly Lord Richard Grosvenor) and also by
Chamberlain.  The former related the part he played in the
promotion of O'Shea's candidature at Liverpool as a supporter of
Mr. Gladstone and the latter quoted a letter in which on
January 22, 1896, he had urged O'Shea to "get Mr. Parnell's
exequatur for one of the vacant seats" in Ireland, as "it is
really the least he can do for you after all you have done for
him."  "Surely," wrote Chamberlain, "it must be to the
interest of the Irish Party to keep open channels of communication
with the Liberal leaders."  The point was clinched by a
letter addressed by Mr. Timothy Harrington to the <i>Freeman's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P292"></a>292}</span>
Journal</i>, stating that "Mr. Parnell, during the Galway election
in 1886, explained to his followers that he had only adopted
Captain O'Shea as candidate for Galway at the special request
of Mr. Chamberlain....  The strongest confirmation was given
to it immediately after the election, when Captain O'Shea
followed Mr. Chamberlain out of the House of Commons, and
refused to vote on the Home Rule Bill."  On this aspect of
the question, O'Shea himself says, in his letter to the Primate:
"If I were such a man as Dr. MacCormack insinuates&mdash;a man
who would buy a seat in Parliament at the price of his
honour&mdash;I need only have given a silent vote for Mr. Gladstone's
Home Rule Bill and my seat was as safe as any in Ireland."

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap27fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap27fn2text">2</a>] Parnell dealt in detail with the question of the Parliamentary
independence of the Irish Party,
and repudiated the right of any English party
to exercise a veto on the Irish leadership.
He described his conversations
at Hawarden with Gladstone in the previous November
on the details of
the scheme to be fathered by the Liberal Party
when it returned to office,
related the circumstances of Morley's suggestion
to him that he should
become Chief Secretary for Ireland,
and referred scornfully to "the
English wolves now howling for my
destruction."  He thought the Irish
people would agree with him that even
if their threats of the indefinite
postponement of a Home Rule scheme were realized,
postponement would
be preferable to a compromise of Irish national rights.

CHAPTER XXVIII
<br />
A KING AT BAY
</h3>

<p class="poem">
"<i>Vulneratus non victus.</i>"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In December a vacancy occurred in Kilkenny, and, on
December 9th, my King started for Ireland, and stayed
with Dr. Kenny for the night in Dublin.  Of the great
meeting in the Rotunda I give Miss Katharine Tynan's
description, because of all the eye-witnesses' accounts of it
that I have kept, none gives the true glimpse of Parnell
as she does.
</p>

<p>
"It was nearly 8.30 when we heard the bands coming;
then the windows were lit up by the lurid glare of
thousands of torches in the street outside.  There was a
distant roaring like the sea.  The great gathering within
waited silently with expectation.  Then the cheering
began, and we craned our necks and looked on eagerly,
and there was the tall, slender, distinguished figure of
the Irish leader making its way across the platform.  I
don't think any words could do justice to his reception.
The house rose at him; everywhere around there was a
sea of passionate faces, loving, admiring, almost
worshipping that silent, pale man.  The cheering broke out
again and again; there was no quelling it.  Mr. Parnell
bowed from side to side, sweeping the assemblage with
his eagle glance.  The people were fairly mad with
excitement.  I don't think anyone outside Ireland can
understand what a charm Mr. Parnell has for the Irish
heart; that wonderful personality of his, his proud
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P294"></a>294}</span>
bearing, his handsome, strong face, the distinction of look
which marks him more than anyone I have ever seen.  All
these are irresistible to the artistic Irish.
</p>

<p>
"I said to Dr. Kenny, who was standing by me, 'He
is the only quiet man here.'  'Outwardly,' said the keen
medical man, emphatically.  Looking again, one saw the
dilated nostrils, the flashing eye, the passionate face; the
leader was simply drinking in thirstily this immense love,
which must have been more heartening than one can say
after that bitter time in the English capital.  Mr. Parnell
looked frail enough in body&mdash;perhaps the black frock-coat,
buttoned so tightly across his chest, gave him that
look of attenuation; but he also looked full of indomitable
spirit and fire.
</p>

<p>
"For a time silence was not obtainable.  Then Father
Walter Hurley climbed on the table and stood with his
arms extended.  It was curious how the attitude silenced
a crowd which could hear no words.
</p>

<p>
"When Mr. Parnell came to speak, the passion within
him found vent.  It was a wonderful speech; not one word
of it for oratorical effect, but every word charged with
a pregnant message to the people who were listening to
him, and the millions who should read him.  It was a
long speech, lasting nearly an hour; but listened to with
intense interest, punctuated by fierce cries against men
whom this crisis has made odious, now and then marked
in a pause by a deep-drawn moan of delight.  It was a
great speech, simple, direct, suave&mdash;with no device and
no artificiality.  Mr. Parnell said long ago, in a furious
moment in the House of Commons, that he cared nothing
for the opinion of the English people.  One remembered
it now, noting his passionate assurances to his own people,
who loved him too well to ask him questions."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P295"></a>295}</span>
</p>

<p>
During this meeting the anti-Parnellites took the
opportunity to seize Parnell's paper, <i>United Ireland</i>, and
the offices.  A witness's account of the incident contained
in Mr. Barry O'Brien's "Life of Charles Stewart Parnell"
appealed to me immensely, because this little affair was
of intense interest to me, and all, or nearly all, I could
get out of Parnell himself on the subject was a soft laugh
and, "It was splendid fun.  I wish I could burgle my
own premises every day!"
</p>

<p>
Something like this appears to have happened.  The
anti-Parnellite garrison was strongly entrenched in the
offices of the newspaper&mdash;doors and windows all barred.
The streets were filled with a crowd of Parnellites crying
death and destruction on the enemy, and pouring in faster
from the side streets.  Men threading their way through
the mass were distributing sticks and revolvers.
</p>

<p>
Parnell had been apprised of the event at the meeting,
and a pony-trap was waiting for him outside the Rotunda.
He got into it with Dr. Kenny, and they dashed off to
the scene of action.  At the sight of their Chief the crowd
went wild; cheers for Parnell and curses for his enemies
filled the air.  At full gallop the pony-trap dashed through
the mass of people (which gave way as if by magic), and
was brought up before the offices with a jerk that sent
the horse sprawling on the ground.  Parnell jumped out
of the trap, sprang up the steps, and knocked loudly at
the door of the offices.  There was a dramatic moment of
silence&mdash;the crowd hushed and expectant.  Then Parnell
quietly gave some orders to those nearest him.  In a brief
space they were off and back again with pickaxe and
crowbar.  Parnell wished to vault the area railings and
attack the area door, but he was held back.  So several
of his followers dropped into the area, while Parnell
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P296"></a>296}</span>
himself attacked the front door with the crowbar.  The door
yielded, and he and many others rushed into the house.
A second party came from the area, and the united force
dashed upstairs.  The rest was a Homeric struggle
between garrison and besiegers, fought from staircase to
staircase and story to story.  At length the garrison was
downed to the last man.  A window of the second story
was removed, and Parnell came out to his people.  He
had lost his hat, his hair was tumbled, his face was quite
white, his eyes were filled with the wild joy of the battle.
His face and clothes were powdered with dust and plaster.
For a moment again the crowd was silent; then it burst
into a roar.
</p>

<p>
Parnell made a short speech, came down, got into the
trap, and drove to the railway station.
</p>

<p>
On the 11th, when he nominated Mr. Vincent Scully,
he stayed at Kilkenny.  That day he wrote to me that
he was feeling ill, and his telegram of "good night" was
weary in tone.  But the next day he wrote that he was
feeling far better, and his letter was very hopeful of
success.  He insisted on returning to me every Saturday,
if it was in any way possible, during these months of
fighting, and going back to Ireland on the next evening,
Sunday.  I begged him to spare himself the fatigue of
this constant journeying, but he could not rest away; so,
in despair, I gave up the fight against my own desire to
have him at home for even these few hours.  This election
lasted ten days.  Polling took place on December 22,
and that morning he telegraphed to me not to expect
victory, so I knew he was sure of defeat long before
the poll was declared.  He returned to Dublin that
night, and addressed a meeting outside the National
Club.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P297"></a>297}</span>
</p>

<p>
It was during one of these last meetings that someone
in the crowd threw lime in the Chief's face.  It has been
said that the thing was a hoax, and that the substance
thrown was flour.  It was not flour, but lime, and had
not Parnell shut his eyes in time he would undoubtedly
have been blinded.  As it was his eyes were not injured,
and but for a tiny scar on the outer edge of his right
eye he was not hurt.  I well remember the awful hours
I passed pacing up and down my room at Brighton
waiting, waiting for news after seeing the morning paper.
He had telegraphed to me directly after the cowardly
assault was made, but he could not send it himself as he
could not leave his friends.  The man to whom he gave
the telegram for dispatch boasted to his fellows that he
had a message from Parnell, and in the crowd and scuffle
it was taken from him; so it was not until midday, when
my own telegram of inquiry reached him, that Parnell
knew that I had not received his; and by the time his
reassuring message arrived I was nearly out of my mind.
The newspapers had made the very most of the affair,
and I thought my husband was blinded.
</p>

<p>
At the end of December Mr. William O'Brien returned
from America, but, as a warrant was out for his arrest,
he could not enter Ireland.  Much against his own
wish Parnell went over to Boulogne to see him, as the
Party were so anxious that he should go.  He did not
think that it would do any good, and, feeling ill, he hated
undertaking the extra fatigue.  He felt, too, that he would
have to fight "all along the line" in Ireland, and
continued the war without cessation, although he went over
to Boulogne several times to hear what Mr. O'Brien
had to say.  He was, however, on good terms with
O'Brien, and suggested him as leader of the Party in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P298"></a>298}</span>
event of his own resignation.  The suggestion did not
prove acceptable to the Party.[<a id="chap28fn1text"></a><a href="#chap28fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
Throughout this time he occasionally attended the
sittings of the House, and, on returning home one sad
evening, he did not speak much after his first greeting.
I felt that something had troubled him unusually, but
forbore to worry him, knowing that he would tell me
presently.  After a while he turned to me, and all he said
was, "O'Kelly has gone too."
</p>

<p>
I did not answer in words, for my heart bled for him
in this the only personal sorrow he had suffered in the
disloyalty of his Party.  Anger, scorn, and contempt,
yes! but this was the first and only blow to his affections.
For the first time since that miserable and most cowardly
exhibition of treachery in Committee Room 15 there was
a little break in his voice.  They had been friends for so
long, and had worked with each other in American and
Irish politics so intimately.  He had loved him, and now
O'Kelly had "gone too."
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Gladstone gave the word, and the insecure
virtue of the country obeyed it, because it is a very
shocking thing to be found out, the anti-Parnellites were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P299"></a>299}</span>
extremely ingenious in inventing new forms of scurrility
in connexion with my supposed name.  From one end of
chivalrous Ireland to the other&mdash;urged on more especially
by a certain emotional Irish member of Parliament&mdash;the
name of "Kitty" O'Shea was sung and screamed,
wrapped about with all the filth that foul minds, vivid
imaginations, and black hatred of the aloof, proud Chief
could evolve, the Chief whom they could not hurt save
through the woman he loved!
</p>

<p>
They hurt him now a little, it is true, but not very
greatly.  My husband said to me after the Kilkenny election,
"It would really have hurt, my Queen, if those devils
had got hold of your real name, my Queenie, or even the
'Katie' or 'Dick' that your relations and Willie called
you."  And then I was glad, so very glad that the gallant
company of mud-slingers had with one accord leapt to
the conclusion that those who love me called me "Kitty"
because my name was Katharine.  For me it was a little
thing to bear for the man who loved me as never woman
has been loved before, and the only thing that I could
not have borne would have been the thought that one of
those who hated him had pierced the armour of his pride
and touched his heart.

<p>
On 22nd April, 1891, Mr. Frederick Kerley wrote from
10, Broad Court, Bow Street, W.C., to Mr. Thomson,
to say that he had succeeded that day in serving
Mr. Parnell with a copy of the Judge's Order, which
Mr. Thomson had handed to him on the evening of the 20th
instant.  He saw Mr. Parnell at 7.5 p.m. pass through
the barrier on to the Brighton platform at Victoria
Station.  He walked by his side and, addressing him,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P300"></a>300}</span>
said, "Mr. Parnell, I believe?"  Parnell replied, "Yes."  He
said he was desired to hand him that paper, at the
same time handing him the copy, when the following
conversation ensued:
</p>

<p>
Parnell: "What is it?"
</p>

<p>
Kerley: "It is a Judge's Order."
</p>

<p>
P.: "Oh, it is the costs."
</p>

<p>
K.: "Yes, it is.  That is a copy, this is the original,
and the signature of Mr. Justice Butt," and Kerley showed
the original to him.
</p>

<p>
P.: "Oh, very well."
</p>

<p>
K.: "This is Mr. Wontner's card, who is the solicitor
in the matter."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Parnell took the card and said, "Thank you."
</p>

<p>
It had all been clone very quietly.  No one saw what
was done, and Parnell was not subjected to the slightest
annoyance, and he did not appear to be the least annoyed.
Kerley did not enclose the original, as he was afraid to
trust it through the post, but would hand it to Mr. Thomson
personally.

[<a href="#chap28fn1text">1</a>] The conversations with O'Brien and Dillon in France and the
correspondence which followed were concerned with the attitude of the Irish
Party towards the details of the Home Rule Bill to be introduced when
the Liberals came into power.  Mr. Justin McCarthy had been elected
leader of the party, but Parnell insisted on his traditional right to a
predominant voice in its decisions.  At the beginning of 1891 there were
anxious discussions about Gladstone's intentions as to the number of Irish
Members to be retained at Westminster and as to the basis of a public
declaration of Liberal policy.  The proposals made to him were not
satisfactory either to Parnell's political judgment
or to his <i>amour propre</i>.  They
came to nothing, however, and both O'Brien and Dillon were arrested
on their return to Ireland and put "out of the way for a bit," as Parnell
said.  He complained of the "depressing effect" these two colleagues had
upon him; it was "so hard to keep them to the difficulties of the moment
while they were so eagerly passing on the troubles of to-morrow."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX
<br />
PARNELL AS I KNEW HIM
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"<i>If I must speake the schoole-master's language, I will confess
that character comes of the infinite moode</i> [Greek: charázo],
<i>which signifieth
to ingrave or make a deep impression.</i>"&mdash;(CHARACTERS) OVERBURY.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When I first met Mr. Parnell in 1880 he was unusually
tall and very thin.  His features were delicate with that
pallid pearly tint of skin that was always peculiarly his.
The shadows under his deep sombre eyes made them
appear larger than they were, and the eyes themselves
were the most striking feature of his cold, handsome face.
They were a deep brown, with no apparent unusualness
about them except an odd compulsion and insistence in
their direct gaze that, while giving the impression that he
was looking through and beyond them, bent men unconsciously
to his will.  But when moved by strong feeling
a thousand little fires seemed to burn and flicker in the
sombre depths, and his cold, inscrutable expression gave
way to a storm of feeling that held one spellbound by its
utter unexpectedness.
</p>

<p>
His hair was very dark brown, with a bronze glint
on it in sunlight, and grew very thickly on the back of
the shapely head, thinning about the high forehead.  His
beard, moustache and eyebrows were a lighter brown.
His features were very delicate, especially about the
fine-cut nostrils; and the upper lip short, though the mouth
was not particularly well shaped.  His was a very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P302"></a>302}</span>
handsome, aristocratic face, very cold, proud and reserved;
almost all the photographs of him render the face too
heavy, and thicken the features.
</p>

<p>
He had an old-world courtliness of manner when
speaking to women, a very quiet, very grave charm of
consideration that appealed to them at once in its silent
tribute to the delicacy of womanhood.  I always thought
his manner to women, whether equals or dependents, was
perfect.  In general society he was gracious without being
familiar, courteous but reserved, interested yet aloof, and
of such an unconscious dignity that no one, man or
woman, ever took a liberty with him.
</p>

<p>
In the society of men his characteristic reserve and
"aloofness" were much more strongly marked, and even
in the true friendship he had with at least two men he
could more easily have died than have lifted the veil of
reserve that hid his inmost feeling.  I do not now allude
to his feeling for myself, but to any strong motive of his
heart&mdash;his love for Ireland and of her peasantry, his
admiration that was almost worship of the great forces of
nature&mdash;the seas and the winds, the wonders of the planet
worlds and the marvels of science.
</p>

<p>
Yet I have known him expand and be thoroughly happy,
and even boyish, in the society of men he trusted.
Immensely, even arrogantly proud, he was still keenly
sensitive and shy, and he was never gratuitously offensive
to anyone.  In debate his thrusts were ever within the
irony permitted to gentlemen at war, even if beyond that
which could be congenial to the Speaker of the House or
to a chairman of committee.
</p>

<p>
He was never petty in battle, and all the abuse, hatred
and execration showered upon him in public and in private,
whether by the opponents of his political life or by the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P303"></a>303}</span>
(self-elected) judges of his private life, caused no
deviation in the policy that was his or on the path that he
meant to tread.  His policy was the outcome of long, silent
deliberation, with every probable issue considered, every
possible contingency allowed for, and then followed up
with quiet, unwearying persistency and determination.
When he succeeded in forcing his will upon the House
it was well, but he was not elated, passing on to the next
point to be gained.  When he failed, he had done his
best; but "the fates" willed otherwise than he, and again
he passed on to the next thing without perturbation.  No
one could flatter Parnell, neither could anyone humiliate
him.  "What I am, I am, what I am not I cannot be,"
was his summing up of his own and of every other man's
personality.
</p>

<p>
His cold, scientific way of sorting out and labelling his
own Party at first made me hesitatingly complain, "But,
after all, they are human beings!" and his characteristic
answer was "In politics, as in war, there are no men, only
weapons."
</p>

<p>
In regard to "Nationalization," he declared that, while
there must be growth, there could be no change, and when
I would point out in friendly malice that his "nationalism"
of one year need not necessarily be that of another, and
could very easily be less comprehensive, he would answer
with smiling scorn, "That only means that lack of
judgment is righted by growth in understanding!"
</p>

<p>
Parnell went into nothing half-heartedly, and was never
content till he had grasped every detail of his subject.
For this reason he gave up the study of astronomy, which
had become of engrossing interest to him, for he said that
astronomy is so enormous a subject that it would have
demanded his whole time and energy to satisfy him.  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P304"></a>304}</span>
was constitutionally lazy, and absolutely loathed
beginning anything, his delicate health having, no doubt,
much to do with this inertia, of which he was very well
aware.  He always made me promise to "worry" him into
making a start on any important political work, meeting
or appointment, when the proper time came, and often I
found this a very sad duty, for he was so absolutely happy
when working at one of his many hobbies, or sitting
quietly in his chair "watching" me, and talking or
keeping silent as the mood possessed him, that it was misery
to me to disturb him and send him off to do something
that was not interesting to him.  He used to comfort me
by assuring me that it was only the "beginnings" he
hated, and that he was all right when he was "once
started."
</p>

<p>
He was extraordinarily modest about his own intellectual
ability, and decidedly underrated the wonderful
powers of his mind, while he had the utmost admiration
for "brain," whether of friend or foe.  Frequently he
would say that that "Grand Old Spider" (his private name
for Mr. Gladstone) was worth fighting because he was
so amazingly clever.  His own followers he picked with
careful consideration of their usefulness to his policy, and
appreciated to the full the occasionally brilliant ability
some of them showed.  His mind, in politics at least, was
analytical, and he would sift, and sort, and mentally
docket each member of the Irish Party, in company with
the more prominent of the Liberal Party, till the whole
assumed to him the aspect of an immense game, in which
he could watch and direct most of the more important
moves.  The policy of the Conservatives he considered to
be too obvious to require study.
</p>

<p>
In character Parnell was curiously complex.  Just,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P305"></a>305}</span>
tender and considerate, he was nevertheless incapable of
forgiving an injury, and most certainly he never forgot
one.  His code of honour forbade him to bring up a
wrong of private life against a public man, and he had
the subtle love of truth that dares to use it as the shield
of expediency.
</p>

<p>
Physically Parnell was so much afraid of pain and
ill-health that he suffered in every little indisposition and
hurt far more than others of less highly strung and
sensitive temperament.  He had such a horror of death that
it was only by the exercise of the greatest self-control that
he could endure the knowledge or sight of it; but his
self-control was so perfect that never by word or deed did he
betray the intense effort and real loathing he suffered when
obliged to attend a funeral, or to be in any way brought
into contact with death or the thought thereof.  Whenever
we passed, in our drive, a churchyard or cemetery he
would turn his head away, or even ask me to take another
road.  The only exception to this very real horror of his
was the little grave of our baby girl at Chislehurst, which
he loved; but then he always said she did not die, "she
only went to sleep."
</p>

<p>
Oppression of the weak and helpless, or any act of
cruelty, filled him with the deep hatred and indignation
that had first led him to make the cause of his hapless
country his own, and he would spend hours in silent,
concentrated thought, altogether oblivious of his surroundings,
working out some point or way to lift a little of the
burden of the wronged.
</p>

<p>
Parnell was very fond of animals, and was their very
good friend always, taking every care himself to see that
his horses and dogs were properly looked after.  During
one of the last meetings he attended in Ireland he jumped
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P306"></a>306}</span>
off his car in the midst of a hostile crowd to rescue a terrier
that was being kicked and run over by the mob.
</p>

<p>
His will was autocratic, and once he had made up his
mind to any course he would brook no interference, nor
suffer anything to stand in his way.  Yet, in his home
life, he would come to no decision without seeking my
approval, and was absolutely unselfish and considerate.  I
have known him deadly white, with the still, cold passion
that any deliberate thwarting of his will produced in him,
sweep aside out of "the Party" and out of all further
recognition in any capacity a man who had done useful
work, and who, thus thrown out, might have been&mdash;and
was&mdash;dangerous to Parnell's political policy in many
ways.  He had gone against Parnell's explicit instructions
in a certain matter.  I ventured to point out that this
man might be dangerous as an enemy, and he answered:
"While I am leader they (the Party) are my tools, or they
go!"  From his servants also he exacted prompt,
unquestioning obedience always, but he was the most gentle
and considerate of masters, and they, as a rule, almost
worshipped him.
</p>

<p>
He had much pride of family and family affection,
but he was utterly undemonstrative and shy.  Even when
he nursed his brother John through a long and painful
illness, caused by a railway accident in America when
they were both very young men, the wall of reserve was
never broken down, and I do not think his family ever
realized how strong his affection for them was.
</p>

<p>
Parnell was not in the least a well-read man.  His
genius was natural and unaided; he was a maker of history,
not a reader of it.  He took no interest in literature
as such, but for works on subjects interesting to
him&mdash;mining, mechanics, or engineering and (later) astronomy&mdash;he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P307"></a>307}</span>
had an insatiable appetite and such a tremendous
power of concentration that he absolutely absorbed
knowledge where he chose.  I have known him to argue some
intricate and technical point of engineering with a man of
thirty years' practical experience (in America and India),
who at length admitted Parnell to be right and himself
mistaken, though on this particular point Parnell's
deductions were made from a two hours' study of the subject
some three years or more before.
</p>

<p>
For pictures he cared not at all, and music he
absolutely disliked; though to amuse me he would sometimes
"sing," in a soft undertone and with much gravity, funny
little nursery rhymes and snatches of the songs of his
college days.
</p>

<p>
His dislike of social life was so great that he would
never accept any invitation that could be in any way
avoided; and if sometimes I absolutely insisted upon his
going to any reception or dinner party, he would go with
the grim determination of one fulfilling a most unpleasant
duty.  He often told me that it was because he hated
"Saxons" (a hatred which years of tradition had fostered)
so much, and felt ill at ease in any gathering of English
people.
</p>

<p>
He certainly did not feel this with the working classes,
with whom he would constantly converse and watch at
work when we were out together.  Agricultural labourers
did not interest him so much, but he used to spend hours
talking to mechanics of all classes, seamen, road-menders,
builders, and any and every kind of artisan.  To these he
always spoke in an easy, friendly way of their work, their
wages, and the conditions of labour, and I never remarked
that suspiciousness and reserve, characteristic of the
English wageworker, in these men when Parnell talked
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P308"></a>308}</span>
with them.  They seemed to accept him, not as one of
themselves, but as an interesting and an interested "labour
leader," who had the unusual merit of wishing to hear their
views instead of offering them his own.
</p>

<p>
Parnell was intensely superstitious, with all the superstition
of the Irish peasant, and in this he was unreasoning
and unreasonable.  This trait was evidently acquired in
earliest childhood and had grown with his growth, for
some of these superstitions are the heritage of ages
in the Irish people, and have their origin in some
perfectly natural fear, or association, that has,
generation by generation, by alteration of habit or
circumstance, lost its force while retaining, or even adding to,
its expression.
</p>

<p>
Parnell would agree perfectly that this was a fact,
nevertheless to do so-and-so was "unlucky," and there
was the end of it&mdash;it must not be done.  Certain
combinations of numbers, of lights or circumstances, were
"omens," and must be carefully avoided.  Evidently, as
an intelligent child will, he had eagerly caught up and
absorbed all and every suggestion offered him by the
converse of his nurse and her associates, and the impressions
thus made were overlaid, but not erased, as he grew up
isolated, by the very reticence of his nature, from his
fellows.  His dislike of the colour green, as being
unlucky, he could not himself understand, for it is
certainly not an Irish feeling, but it was there so decidedly
that he would not sit in any room that had this colour in
it, nor would he allow me to wear or use any of the
magnificent silks or embroideries that were so often presented
to him, if, as was generally the case, they had green in
their composition.
</p>

<p>
Parnell had no religious conviction of creed and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P309"></a>309}</span>
dogma, but he had an immense reverence, learnt, I think,
from the Irish peasantry, for any genuine religious
conviction.  He personally believed in a vast and universal
law of "attraction," of which the elemental forces of Nature
were part, and the whole of which tended towards some
unknown, and unknowable, end, in immensely distant
periods of time.  The world, he considered, was but a
small part of the unthinkably vast "whole" through which
the "Spirit" (the soul) of man passed towards the fulfilment
of its destiny in the completion of "attraction."  Of
a first "Cause" and predestined "End" he was convinced,
though he believed their attributes to be unknown and
unknowable.
</p>

<p>
As I have said before, he was not a man who read,
or sought to acquire the opinions or knowledge of others,
unless he had some peculiar interest in a subject.  He
considered, and formed his own beliefs and opinions,
holding them with the same quiet, convinced recognition
of his right of judgment that he extended to the judgment
of others.
</p>

<p>
Parnell's moral standard was a high one, if it is once
conceded that as regards the marriage bond his honest
conviction was that there is none where intense mutual
attraction&mdash;commonly called love&mdash;does not exist, <i>or where
it ceases to exist</i>.  To Parnell's heart and conscience I
was no more the wife of Captain O'Shea when he (Parnell)
first met me than I was after Captain O'Shea had divorced
me, ten years later.  He took nothing from Captain
O'Shea that the law of the land could give, or could
dispossess him of, therefore he did him no wrong.  I do not
presume to say whether in this conviction he was right or
wrong, but here I set down Parnell's point of view, with
the happy knowledge that never for one moment have I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P310"></a>310}</span>
regretted that I made his point of view my own in this as
in all things else.
</p>

<p>
Parnell's political life was one single-minded ambition
for the good of his country.  He was no place or
popularity hunter.  Stung to the quick in early manhood
by the awful suffering of the Irish peasantry and by the
callous indifference of the English Government, he, with
all the pure chivalry of youth, vowed himself to their
service, and, so far as in him lay, to the forcing of the
governing country to a better fulfilment of her
responsibilities.  In the course of years the gaining of Home Rule
for Ireland became for him the only solution of the
problem.  To this end he devoted all his energies, and
for this end men became as tools to him, to be used and
thrown aside, so that he could carve out the liberation of
Ireland from the great nation whom he declared could
"rule slaves as freemen, but who would only rule free men
as slaves."
</p>

<p>
Some have said that Parnell was avaricious.  He was
not.  In small matters he was careful, and on himself
he spent the very smallest amount possible for his position.
He indulged himself in no luxuries beyond the purchase
of a few scientific books and instruments, on which
indulgence he spent many moments of anxious deliberation
lest he should need the money for political purposes.  His
own private income was spent in forwarding his political
work, in the "relief funds" of Ireland's many needs, and
on his estates in Ireland, where he did his utmost to
promote industries that should prove to be of real benefit to
the people.  To his mother and other near relations he
was always generous, and to the many calls upon his
charity <i>in Ireland</i> he was rarely unresponsive.
</p>

<p>
In temper Parnell was quiet, deep and bitter.  He was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P311"></a>311}</span>
so absolutely self-controlled that few knew of the volcanic
force and fire that burned beneath his icy exterior.
</p>

<p>
In the presence of suffering he was gentle, unselfish
and helpful.  Indeed, I may say that at all times at home
he was the most unselfish man I have ever met.
</p>

<p>
Of his moral courage all the world knows, yet no one,
I think, but myself can know how absolute it was; how
dauntless and unshaken, how absolutely and unconsciously
heroic Parnell's courage was.  Through good
report, or ill report, in his public life, or in his private
life, he never changed, never wavered.  Hailed as his
country's saviour, execrated as her betrayer, exalted as a
conqueror, or judged and condemned by the self-elected
court of English hypocrisy, he kept a serene heart and
unembittered mind, treading the path he had chosen, and
doing the work he had made his own for Ireland's sake.
</p>

<p>
And there are those who can in no way understand
that some few men are born who stand apart, by the very
grandeur of Nature's plan&mdash;men of whom it is true to say
that "after making him the mould was broken," and of
whom the average law can neither judge aright nor
understand.  In his childhood, in his boyhood, and in his
manhood Parnell was "apart."  I was the one human
being admitted into the inner sanctuaries of his soul, with
all their intricate glooms and dazzling lights; mine was
not the folly to judge, but the love to understand.

<p>
On June 24th, 1891, Mr. Parnell drove over to Steyning
to see that all the arrangements for our marriage at the
registrar's office there on the next day were complete.
Mr. Edward Cripps, the registrar, had everything in order,
and it was arranged that we should come very early so
as to baffle the newspaper correspondents, who had already
been worrying Mr. Cripps, and who hung about our house
at Brighton with an inconvenient pertinacity.  We had
given Mr. Parnell's servant elaborate orders to await us,
with Dictator in the phaeton, at a short distance from the
house about eleven o'clock on the 25th, and told him he
would be required as a witness at our wedding.  This
little ruse gave us the early morning of the 25th clear, as
the newspaper men soon had these instructions out of the
discomfited young man, who had been told not to talk to
reporters.
</p>

<p>
On June 25th I was awakened at daybreak by my
lover's tapping at my door and calling to me: "Get up,
get up, it is time to be married!"  Then a humming and
excitement began through the house as the maids flew
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P313"></a>313}</span>
about to get us and breakfast ready "in time," before two
of them, Phyllis Bryson, my very dear personal maid&mdash;who
had put off her own marriage for many years in order
to remain with me&mdash;and my children's old nurse, drove
off to catch the early train to Steyning, where they were
to be witnesses of our marriage.  Phyllis was so determined
to put the finishing touches to me herself that she
was at last hustled off by Parnell, who was in a nervous
fear that everyone would be late but the newspaper men.
Phyllis was fastening a posy at my breast when Parnell
gently but firmly took it from her and replaced it with
white roses he had got for me the day before.  Seeing her
look of disappointment he said, "She must wear mine
to-day, Phyllis, but she shall carry yours, and you shall
keep them in remembrance; now you must go!"
</p>

<p>
He drove the maids down the stairs and into the waiting
cab, going himself to the stables some way from the
house, and returning in an amazingly short time with
Dictator in the phaeton and with a ruffled-looking groom
who appeared to have been sleeping in his livery&mdash;it was
so badly put on.  Parnell ordered him in to have a cup
of tea and something to eat while he held the horse,
nervously calling to me at my window to be quick and
come down.  Then, giving the groom an enormous
"buttonhole," with fierce orders not to dare to put it
on till we were well on our way, Parnell escorted me
out of the house, and settled me in the phaeton with
elaborate care.
</p>

<p>
As a rule Parnell never noticed what I wore.  Clothes
were always "things" to him.  "Your things become you
always" was the utmost compliment for a new gown I
could ever extract from him; but that morning, as he
climbed in beside me and I took the reins, he said,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P314"></a>314}</span>
"Queenie, you look lovely in that lace stuff and the
beautiful hat with the roses!  I am so proud of you!"
</p>

<p>
And I was proud of my King, of my wonderful lover,
as we drove through that glorious June morning, past the
fields of growing corn, by the hedges heavy with wild
roses and "traveller's joy," round the bend of the river
at Lancing, past the ruined tower where we had so often
watched the kestrels hover, over the bridge and up the
street of pretty, old-world Bramber into Steyning, and
on to the consummation of our happiness.
</p>

<p>
Parnell hardly spoke at all during this drive.  Only,
soon after the start at six o'clock, he said, "Listen," and,
smiling, "They are after us; let Dictator go!" as we
heard the clattering of horses far behind.  I let Dictator
go, and he&mdash;the fastest (driving) horse I have ever
seen&mdash;skimmed over the nine miles in so gallant a mood that it
seemed to us but a few minutes' journey.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cripps was in attendance, and Mrs. Cripps had
very charmingly decorated the little room with flowers,
so there was none of the dreariness usual with a registry
marriage.  As we waited for our witnesses to arrive&mdash;we
had beaten the train!&mdash;my King looked at us both in the
small mirror on the wall of the little room, and, adjusting
his white rose in his frock-coat, said joyously, "It isn't
every woman who makes so good a marriage as you are
making, Queenie, is it? and to such a handsome fellow,
too!" blowing kisses to me in the glass.  Then the two
maids arrived, and the little ceremony that was to legalize
our union of many years was quickly over.
</p>

<p>
On the return drive my husband pulled up the hood
of the phaeton, and, to my questioning look&mdash;for it was
a hot morning&mdash;he answered solemnly, "It's the right
thing to do."  As we drove off, bowing and laughing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P315"></a>315}</span>
our thanks to Mr. Cripps and the others for their kind
and enthusiastic felicitations, he said, "How could I kiss
you good wishes for our married life unless we were hooded
up like this!"
</p>

<p>
Just as we drove out of Steyning we passed the
newspaper men arriving at a gallop, and we peered out
doubtfully at them, fearing they would turn and come
back after us.  But I let Dictator have his head, and,
though they pulled up, they knew that pursuit was
hopeless.  My husband looked back round the hood of the
phaeton, and the groom called out delightedly, "They've
give up, and gone on to Mr. Cripps, sir."
</p>

<p>
On our return to Walsingham Terrace we had to run
the gauntlet between waiting Pressmen up the steps to
the house, but at my husband's imperious "Stand back;
let Mrs. Parnell pass!  Presently, presently; I'll see you
presently!" they fell back, and we hid ourselves in the
house and sat down to our dainty little wedding breakfast.
Parnell would not allow me to have a wedding cake,
because he said he would not be able to bear seeing me eat
our wedding cake without him, and, as I knew, the very
sight of a rich cake made him ill.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the reporters had taken a firm stand at
the front door, and were worrying the servants to exasperation.
One, a lady reporter for an American newspaper,
being more enterprising than the rest, got into the house
adjoining ours, which I also rented at that time, and came
through the door of communication on the balcony into
my bedroom.  Here she was found by Phyllis, and as
my furious little maid was too small to turn the American
lady out, she slipped out of the door and locked it, to
prevent further intrusion.
</p>

<p>
Then she came down to us in the dining-room, found
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P316"></a>316}</span>
on the way that the cook had basely given in to bribery,
having "Just let one of the poor gentlemen stand in the
hall," and gave up the battle in despair&mdash;saying, "Will
Mrs. O'Shea see him, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; wants to know?"
</p>

<p>
"Phyllis!" exclaimed my husband in a horrified voice,
"what do you mean?  <i>Who</i> is Mrs. O'Shea?"
</p>

<p>
Poor Phyllis gave one gasp at me and fled in confusion.
</p>

<p>
Then my King saw some of the newspaper people, and
eased their minds of their duty to their respective papers.
The lady from America he utterly refused to see, as she
had forced herself into my room, but, undaunted, she left
vowing that she would cable a better "interview" than any
of them to her paper.  They were kind enough to send it
to me in due course, and I must admit that even if not
exactly accurate, it was distinctly "bright."  It was an
illustrated "interview," and Parnell and I appeared seated
together on a stout little sofa, he clad in a fur coat, and
I in a dangerously <i>décolleté</i> garment, diaphanous in the
extreme, and apparently attached to me by large diamonds.
My sedate Phyllis had become a stage "grisette" of most
frivolous demeanour, and my poor bedroom&mdash;in fact, the
most solid and ugly emanation of Early Victorian virtue
I have ever had bequeathed to me&mdash;appeared to an
interested American State as the "very utmost" in fluffy
viciousness that could be evolved in the united capitals
of the demi-mondaine.
</p>

<p>
I showed this "interview" to my husband, though
rather doubtful if he would be amused by it; but he only
said, staring sadly at it, "I don't think that American
lady can be a very nice person."
</p>

<p>
After he had sent the reporters off my King settled into
his old coat again, and subsided into his easy chair,
smoking and quietly watching me.  I told him he must
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P317"></a>317}</span>
give up that close scrutiny of me, and that I did not stare
at him till he grew shy.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" he said.  "A cat may look at a king,
and surely a man may look at his wife!"
</p>

<p>
But I refused to stay indoors talking nonsense on so
lovely a day, and we wandered out together along the
fields to Aldrington.  Along there is a place where they
make bricks.  We stood to watch the men at work, and
Parnell talked to them till they went off to dinner.  Parnell
watched them away till they were out of sight, and then
said, "Come on, Queenie, we'll make some bricks, too.
I've learnt all about it in watching them!"  So we very
carefully made two bricks between us, and put them with
the others in the kiln to burn.  I suggested marking our
two bricks, so that we might know them when we returned,
but when we looked in the kiln some hours later they all
appeared alike.
</p>

<p>
Then we got down to the sea and sat down to watch it
and rest.  Far beyond the basin at Aldrington, near the
mouth of Shoreham Harbour, we had the shore to ourselves
and talked of the future, when Ireland had settled
down, and my King&mdash;king, indeed, in forcing reason upon
that unreasonable land and wresting the justice of Home
Rule from England&mdash;could abdicate; when we could go
to find a better climate, so that his health might become all
I wished.  We talked of the summer visits we would make
to Avondale, and of the glorious days when he need never
go away from me.  Of the time when his hobbies could be
pursued to the end, instead of broken off for political work.
And we talked of Ireland, for Parnell loved her, and what
he loved I would not hate or thrust out from his thoughts,
even on this day that God had made.
</p>

<p>
Yet, as we sat together, silent now, even though we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P318"></a>318}</span>
spoke together still with the happiness that has no words,
a storm came over the sea.  It had been very hot all day
and a thunderstorm was inevitable; but, as we sheltered
under the breakwater, I wished that this one day might
have been without a storm.
</p>

<p>
Reading my thoughts, he said: "The storms and
thunderings will never hurt us now, Queenie, my wife,
for there is nothing in the wide world that can be greater
than our love; there is nothing in all the world but you
and I."  And I was comforted because I did not remember
death.
</p>

<p>
The news of our marriage was in all the evening papers,
and already that night began the bombardment of telegrams
and letters of congratulation and otherwise!  The
first telegram was to me, "Mrs. Parnell," and we opened
it together with much interest and read its kind message
from "Six Irish Girls" with great pleasure.  The others,
the number of which ran into many hundreds, varied from
the heartiest congratulation to the foulest abuse, and were
equally of no moment to my husband, as he made no
attempt to open anything in the ever-growing heap of
correspondence that, for weeks I kept on a large tray in
my sitting-room, and which, by making a determined
effort daily, I kept within bounds.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you have to open them all?" he asked me,
looking at the heap with the indolent disgust that always
characterized him at the sight of many letters.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I like reading the nice ones, and I can't tell
which they are till they're opened," I explained.  "Now
here is one that looks the very epitome of all that is good
and land outside-thick, good paper, beautiful
handwriting&mdash;and yet the inside is unprintable!"
</p>

<p>
Parnell held out his hand for it, but I would not give
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P319"></a>319}</span>
anything so dirty into his hand, and tore it across for the
wastepaper basket, giving him instead a dear little letter
from a peasant woman in Ireland, who invoked more
blessings upon our heads than Heaven could well spare us.
</p>

<p>
Little more than three months afterwards the telegrams
and letters again poured into the house.  This time they
were messages of condolence, and otherwise.  And again
their message fell upon unheeding ears, for the still, cold
form lying in the proud tranquillity of death had taken
with him all my sorrow and my joy; and as in that perfect
happiness I had known no bitterness, for he was there,
now again these words of venom, speaking gladness
because he was dead, held no sting for me, for he was gone,
and with him took my heart.
</p>

<p>
The very many letters of true sympathy which reached
me after my husband's death were put away in boxes, and
kept for me till I was well enough for my daughter to read
them to me.  Among these were many from clergymen of
all denominations and of all ranks in the great army of
God.  As I lay with closed eyes listening to the message
of these hearts I did not know I seemed to be back in the
little church at Cressing, and to hear my father's voice
through the mists of remembrance, saying: "And now
abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest
of these is <i>Charity</i>." ...
</p>

<p>
Among our many wedding presents was a charming
little alabaster clock from my husband's sister, Emily
Dickinson.  It was a ship's "wheel," and we were very
gay over its coming, disputing as to which of us should
henceforth be the "man at the wheel."  Parnell's mother
also was very sweet and kind to me, sending me several
much prized letters.  Other members of my husband's
family also wrote very kindly to me, and I can still see
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P320"></a>320}</span>
his tender smile at me as he saw my appreciation of his
family's attitude.
</p>

<p>
The presents we liked best, after Mrs. Dickinson's
clock, were the little humble offerings of little value and
much love sent by working men and women, by our servants,
and by others of far countries and near.  Parcels
arrived from the four quarters of the globe, and many
were beyond recognition on arrival, but the fragments
were grateful to me as bearing a message of true homage
to my King.
</p>

<p>
Of other feeling there was little among these wedding
gifts, though one evening my eldest daughter who was
with me, remarked casually to me that she had confiscated
a newly arrived "registered" parcel addressed to me.
"Oh, but you must not," I exclaimed, "I want them all!"  But
she answered gloomily that this parcel had contained
a mouse, and "not at all the kind of mouse that anyone
could have wanted for days past."  So I subsided without
further interrogation.
</p>

<p>
Once when Parnell and I were staying at Bournemouth
we became very fond of some old engravings hanging
in our hotel sitting-room, illustrating "The Dowie
Dens of Yarrow," and now, through these fighting months
in Ireland, we used this old ballad as a medium for private
telegrams, as we could not be sure they would not fall
into other hands.  The idea took root when he first left
me to attend what I feared would be a hostile meeting in
Ireland.  He had wired the political result to me, but had
not said how he was feeling.  I telegraphed to him: "O
gentle wind that bloweth south," and promptly came the
reply to me: "He fareth well."
</p>

<p>
All through these fighting months in Ireland he
telegraphed to me always in the morning and also in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P321"></a>321}</span>
evening of every day he was away from me, and whenever
he could snatch a moment he wrote to me.  He was in
no way unhappy in this last fight, and had only the
insidious "tiredness" that grew upon him with such deadly
foreshadowing of the end we would not see given him
a little respite, he could, he said, have enjoyed the stress
and storm of battle.  To bend these rebels in Ireland to his
will became but a secondary driving force to that of gaining
for Ireland the self-government to which he had pledged
himself for her, and I think it gave that zest and joy in
hardness to the battle that all the great fighters of the
world seem to have experienced.
</p>

<p>
I am not giving all his letters of this time; just a few
of the little messages of my husband's love in these last
days I must keep for my own heart to live upon; but the
two or three that I give are sufficient to show the high,
quiet spirit of the man who was said to be "at bay."  Letters,
I think, rather of a king, serene in his belief in
the ultimate sanity of his people and of the justice of his
cause.

<p>
On my husband's return home from Ireland in
September, after having established the <i>Irish Daily
Independent</i>, he was looking so worn out and ill that
I was thoroughly alarmed about his health.  He was very
cheerful and happy while he was at home, and I had much
difficulty in keeping him quietly lying down to rest on
the sofa.  But, though he protested while following my
wishes, I saw as I sat watching him while he slept that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P324"></a>324}</span>
the tired, grey shadows were growing deeper upon his
beautiful face, and that in sleep he had that absolute
stillness which one only finds in very healthy children or in
the absolutely exhausted sleep of adults.
</p>

<p>
I tried to induce him to see Sir Henry Thompson in
town, but he would not consent&mdash;saying that he could
not waste a moment of his little time at home, and that,
though he did feel tired, that was all.
</p>

<p>
"I am not ill," he said, "only a little tired.  Queenie,
my wife, you do not really think I am ill, do you?"
</p>

<p>
Knowing the one weakness of his brave heart, his
anger and terror at the idea of illness and of the far-off
death that might divide us, I answered only that I thought
he was too tired, that nothing, not even Ireland, was worth
it, and I besought him now at last to give it all up, and
to hide away with me till a long rest, away from the
turmoil and contention, had saved him from the tiredness
that would, I feared, become real illness if he went on.
</p>

<p>
He lay watching me as I spoke, and, after a long pause,
he answered, "I am in your hands, Queenie, and you
shall do with me what you will; but you promised."
</p>

<p>
"You mean I promised that I would never make you
less than&mdash;&mdash;-"
</p>

<p>
"Less than your King," he interrupted, "and if I
give in now I shall be less than that.  I would rather die
than give in now&mdash;give in to the howling of the English
mob.  But if you say it I will do it, and you will never
hear of it again from me, my love, my own wife."  And
as I gazed down into the deep, smouldering eyes, where the
little flames always leapt out to meet mine, I knew I could
not say it, I knew that in the depths of those eyes was more
than even my love could fathom, that in the martyrdom of
our love was to be our reparation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P325"></a>325}</span>
</p>

<p>
I sent him off bright and happy to the last meeting
at Creggs.  As he drove off to the station and Dictator
rounded the corner of the house, he turned, as usual, to
wave to me, and raised the white rose in his buttonhole
to his lips with an answering smile.
</p>

<p>
He sent me a telegram from London as he was starting
from Euston Station, one from Holyhead, and another
from Dublin.  For the Creggs meeting he stayed with
Mr. and Mrs. Mahoney, and his telegram from their
house was cheerful, though he said he was not feeling
very well.
</p>

<p>
In the few lines I had from him here I knew he was in
much pain again from the rheumatism in his left arm.  He
always told me exactly how he was feeling, as he knew
that unless he did this I would have suffered untold misery
from apprehension while he was away.  From Creggs he
telegraphed that he was about to speak, and it was "terrible
weather."  I thought with satisfaction that I had put a
special change into a bag for him, and he had promised
not to be parted from it, so I knew he would find means
of changing his things directly after the meeting.  His
"good night" telegram did not reassure me; he was in
bad pain from the rheumatism, but hoped to get it out
with a Turkish bath on the way home.
</p>

<p>
He stayed in Dublin to see about the new paper which
though "going" well, was a perpetual trouble to him
owing to the petty jealousies of the staff.  He crossed
over from Ireland feeling very ill, with violent pains all
over him; he was implored to go to bed, and remain there
for a few days till he felt better, before starting for
England; but he only replied: "No, I want to get home;
I must go home!"
</p>

<p>
He telegraphed to me from Holyhead as usual, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P326"></a>326}</span>
directly he got to London, and before coming on to
Brighton he had a Turkish bath in London.
</p>

<p>
He seemed to me very weak when he got out of the
buggy.  I had sent a closed fly to meet him, as well as
the buggy, but as a forlorn hope, for he would always be
met by Dictator in the buggy at the station
</p>

<p>
I helped him into the house, and he sank into his own
chair before the blazing fire I had made, in spite of the
warm weather, and said: "Oh, my Wifie, it is good to be
back.  You may keep me a bit now!"
</p>

<p>
I was rather worried that he should have travelled
immediately after a Turkish bath, but he said it had done
him much good.  I did not worry him then, but after he
had eaten a fairly good dinner I told him that I wanted
him to have Sir Henry Thompson down the next day.
He laughed at the idea, but I was very much in
earnest, and he said he would see how he felt in the
morning.
</p>

<p>
He told me that he had had to have his arm in a sling
all the time he was away, but that he thought he had
become so much worse because the change of clothes I had
packed separately in a small bag (which he had promised
not to be parted from) in case he had to speak in the rain,
had been taken home in error by his host, and he had had
to sit in his wet things for some hours.
</p>

<p>
I was much vexed when I heard this, for I always
made such a point of his not keeping on damp things,
and provided against it so carefully when starting him off.
</p>

<p>
He said: "It is no matter, really, I think, and I won't
go away again till I'm really well this time.  They were
all so kind to me, but I was feeling so ill that I had to
point out that breakfast was made for me, not I for
breakfast, when I was expected to come down quickly for it.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P327"></a>327}</span>
I do hate being away from home, especially when I feel
ill."
</p>

<p>
After dinner that night he sat before the fire trying
to smoke a cigar, but he did not care for it as usual,
and presently threw it away half smoked.  He wanted to
"feel" I was there, he said, so I sat by his feet on the
rug, and leant my head against his knee while he stroked
my hair.  I stopped his hand because I feared the pain
might come on again, and held it while he smiled assent
to my suggestion that he should try to sleep a little.
Grouse and Pincher, our setter and terrier, had to come
close by us, and, as they settled by his feet, he said:
"This is really a beautiful rest."
</p>

<p>
He dozed now and then, and I could see how wan and
exhausted the still, clear-cut face was, and I vowed to
myself that he should not again leave my care until his
health was completely re-established.
</p>

<p>
Presently he asked for his stick and wanted to go into
the other room for a while, but he could not walk without
my assistance, his legs were too weak to support him.
I was terribly worried now, but did not let him see it,
and only said: "Now you are up you must let me help
you to bed, so that you can get all the rest you need&mdash;and
you are not going to leave home again till you take
me for a real honeymoon in a country where the sun is
strong enough to get the cold out of your bones.  We
will get out of England this winter."  And he answered:
"So we will, Wifie, directly I get that mortgage through."
</p>

<p>
Then, as we made our painful way up the stairs&mdash;for
the last time&mdash;he laughed at the Irish setter, who was
trying to help him lift the stick he used, and said: "Grouse
thinks we are doing this for his own special benefit."  I
undressed him, and got him into bed, and he said: "Come
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P328"></a>328}</span>
and lie down as quickly as you can, Wifie," but I rubbed
him with the firwood oil, and packed his arm in the wool
he so much believed in, before I lay down.
</p>

<p>
He dozed off, but woke shortly, and could not sleep
again.  He asked me if I thought the champagne
Dr. Kenny had made him take in Dublin had made him worse,
but I reassured him, for he had been so exhausted he had
required something, and no doubt Dr. Kenny had known
that it would do him good, although in a general way
it was bad for him.
</p>

<p>
During the night I made him promise he would see a
doctor in the morning.  Presently he said: "I would
rather write to Thompson, as he understands me."  I
said I would telegraph to him to come down, but this
excited my husband, who said, "No, the fee would be
enormous at this distance."  I pointed out that his health
was more precious than the quarries and saw-mills at
Arklow, on which he was just proposing to spend some
hundreds of pounds, but he put me off with, "We'll make
it all right in the morning, Wifie."
</p>

<p>
Finding he still did not sleep, I gently massaged his
shoulders and arms with oil, and wrapped him in wool
again.
</p>

<p>
He talked a good deal, chiefly of the Irish peasantry,
of their privations and sufferings, the deadly poverty and
the prevalence of the very pain (rheumatism) from which
he was suffering, in their case aggravated by the damp,
insanitary cabins in which they lived.  And he murmured
under his breath: "There are no means at hand for
calculating the people who suffered in silence during those
awful years of famine."  That was what J. H. Mohonagy
said of the famine, from '79 to '80.  And he went on:
"I wish I could do something for them&mdash;the Irish
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P329"></a>329}</span>
peasantry&mdash;they are worth helping.  I have always wished
it, but there is so much between&mdash;and they 'suffer in
silence,' Wifie."
</p>

<p>
In the morning he felt better, and was much happier
about himself.  He absolutely refused to let me send for
Sir Henry Thompson, and, sitting up in bed after a good
breakfast, smoked a cigar while he wrote notes for a
speech.  During his last absence I had bought a large
engraving of Lord Leighton's picture "Wedded," and,
seeing this hanging in the room, he made me bring it
and put it up at the foot of the bed for him to see.  He
was very much amused at the muscular young couple in
the picture, and waving his cigar at it said: "We are a
fine pair, Wifie; hang us up where I can look at us."
</p>

<p>
I had ready for him to sign an agreement to rent a
house near Merstham, Surrey, that we had arranged to
take so that he could get to London more quickly, and
have a change from the sea.  It was a pretty little country
house, and he had taken great interest in it.  I would not
let him sign it now, or do any business, but he made me
read the agreement over to him, and said that part of our
real "honeymoon" should be spent there.  He later
insisted upon writing to his solicitor (his brother-in-law,
Mr. MacDermott) about a mortgage he was raising on his
estate, as he wished to have the matter completed quickly.
(It was not completed, owing to his death.)
</p>

<p>
On Sunday he was not so well, but insisted that what
he had written to Sir Henry Thompson was enough, as
he would answer at once.  My persistence seemed to fret
him so much that I desisted, and told him that I had sent
for a local doctor, as I could not bear to be without advice
about the pain.
</p>

<p>
He was a good patient in one way, scrupulously
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P330"></a>330}</span>
following his doctor's directions, but in another a very difficult
patient, as he was so very easily depressed about himself,
all the fatalism that was natural to him tending to
overcome his immense desire for health.  A short talk with
the doctor who saw him seemed to inspire him with
confidence, and he said he felt better.
</p>

<p>
That night (Sunday) he did not sleep, and this worried
him a great deal, as he had a superstition that if he did
not sleep for two consecutive nights he would die.  I tried
at first to reason him out of this idea, but he said he had
always "felt" this, and had never before failed to sleep.
I besought him to let me telegraph for Sir Henry Thompson
now, but he would not allow it, and became so feverish
at the idea that I did not press the point, though I
determined to consult the doctor in attendance about this in
the morning.  Towards morning he became very feverish,
and it was difficult to keep his skin in the perspiration
that he desired.
</p>

<p>
That morning Sir Henry Thompson telegraphed
recommending me to call in Dr. Willoughby Furner, but as
Dr. Jowers was already in attendance, and my husband
liked him, there was no reason to change.  That day he
was in much pain, afraid to move a finger because of it.
He heard from Sir Henry Thompson and, after I read the
letter to him, he said: "You see, sweetheart, I was right;
Thompson says just what Jowers does; there's no need to
have him down."

<p>
After my husband's death I received the following
letters from Sir Henry Thompson:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
  35 WIMPOLE STREET, W.,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>October</i> 7, 1891.<br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
DEAR MRS. PARNELL,&mdash;I am indeed shocked and distressed
by the news which the afternoon journals announce here to-day.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P331"></a>331}</span>
</p>

<p class="letter">
So little did I think when I received the letter written by
my old esteemed patient, dated October 3, that his end was
so near.
</p>

<p class="letter">
With the feelings which this shock have aroused I cannot
do otherwise than ask permission to express my sincere
sympathy and condolence in the terrible and, I imagine, even to
you who must have known more of his health than anyone
else, this sudden affliction.  The more so as I think you
accompanied him once, if not more than once, in his visits to me in
Wimpole Street.  Of such expression of feeling towards you
in this great trial you will at least find multitudes ready to
join, and may find some slight consolation in the knowledge
that sympathy with you will be widely felt both here and in
America.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Under present circumstances I cannot expect or wish to
trouble you to communicate with me.  But I should be deeply
interested in knowing (for my private interest in him and in
what befell him) what followed the communication I made
to you, whether you had attendance (professional) on the spot
before my letter arrived, and what was said, or supposed, to
have been the cause of the fatal result, or any details which
some friend could send me.
</p>

<p class="letter">
With renewed assurance of my deep sympathy,&mdash;Believe
me, yours truly, HENRY THOMPSON.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I think I must have received one of his very last letters,
if not his last.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
  35 WIMPOLE STREET, W.,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Saturday afternoon, October</i> 10, 1891.<br />
</p>

<p class="letter">
DEAR MRS. PARNELL,&mdash;I am very glad you have written
me, if the doing so, or if the reply I may be able to send you,
can in any way help to mitigate any one of the numerous and
infinitely painful circumstances, or their influence, rather, on
your mind just now.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Such inquiries as those which suggest themselves to you
are so natural that it is impossible to repress them.
</p>

<p class="letter">
One never knows exactly what might have happened in
any incident of life had some other course been taken.  But
whatever course may be supposed, it is useless to pursue it,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P332"></a>332}</span>
since only one can ever be taken in this life, namely, that one
which is chosen by the individual in every case.
</p>

<p class="letter">
In reference to that asked by you, I feel very strongly that
the sad catastrophe was by no means the outcome of any one
act&mdash;or omission to act&mdash;and is far more truly indicated in
that passage in yours which describes him as saying to
Dr. Jowers, "had he only been able to follow my advice during
the last few months," etc.  There is the gist of the matter!  I
doubt whether anything would have saved him when passing
through London.  A blow had been struck&mdash;not so
heavy&mdash;apparently a light one; but his worn-out constitution, of
late fearfully overtaxed by a spirit too strong for its bodily
tenement, had no power to resist, and gave way, wholly
unable to make any fight for itself against the enemy.  Hence
what would in a fairly robust state of health have been only
a temporary conflict with a mild attack of inflammation,
developed into a severe form, overwhelming the vital force
with great rapidity and rendering all medical aid powerless.
I don't believe that any medicine, any treatment, could have
enabled his weakened condition to resist successfully.  He
wanted no medicine to combat the complaint.  He wanted
physical force, increased vitality to keep the attack at bay.  I
have nothing to say of the prescription, except that it appears
to me quite appropriate under the circumstances and these
I have learnt from the public Press.  Dr. Jowers is an
experienced and most capable man, and I think you may rest assured
that he could scarcely have been in safer hands.
</p>

<p class="letter">
If I were to regret anything it would be that he had not
found a spare half-hour to come and see me <i>some time ago</i>.
Let me see then how his strength was and whether he could
not be fortified a little for the wearing life he was leading.
But then these are acts of prudence and foresight which very
few ardent men of action ever find time to take.  Nevertheless,
it is then that advice is really efficient.  It is in nine times
out of ten sought too late; when it is indeed a matter of little
consequence what prescription is written, or, indeed, who has
written it, provided only that it does no mischief.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I should very much have liked to see him again at any
time.  After the first visit I always knew my patient, and
felt much interested in him, although I never showed any
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P333"></a>333}</span>
reference to the fact, preferring to follow his own lead in reference
to name, a matter he refers to in the letter of the 3rd inst.
</p>

<p class="letter">
By the way, you know, of course, I received that letter only
on Monday morning, and lost not an instant in replying,
telegraphing that I was doing so.
</p>

<p class="letter">
You ask me to return it&mdash;"<i>his last letter</i>"&mdash;as I suspected.
I cannot tell you how I was valuing it, and that I intended to
place it among my most treasured souvenirs, of which I have
many.  But I cannot refuse it to his suffering and heart-broken
widow, if she desires me to return it, and will do so.
It consists only of a few professional words, a patient to his
doctor&mdash;nothing more, and it is addressed by yourself&mdash;as I
believe.  It is not here&mdash;I am writing at the club; but if you
still ask me I cannot hesitate an instant, and will send it to you.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Come and see me any time you are able, by and by.  I
will answer any inquiries you may wish to make.  I am at
home (only let me know a day beforehand, if you can) every
morning from 9.30 to 12&mdash;not after, except by quite special
arrangement.
</p>

<p class="letter">
With sincere sympathy, believe me, dear Mrs. Parnell,
yours truly, HENRY THOMPSON.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
My husband was in great pain on the Monday, and
seemed to feel a sudden horror that he was being held
down by some strong unseen power, and asked my
help&mdash;thank God, always my help&mdash;to fight against it.  He
tried to get out of bed, although he was too weak to stand,
and I had to gently force him back, and cover him up,
telling him how dangerous a chill would be.  He said:
"Hold me tight, then, yourself, till I can fight those
others."  Then he seemed to doze for a few minutes, and
when he opened his eyes again it was to ask me to lie
down beside him and put my hand in his, so that he could
"feel" I was there.  I did so, and he lay still, quite happy
again, and spoke of the "sunny land" where we would
go as soon as he was better.  "We will be so happy,
Queenie; there are so many things happier than politics."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P334"></a>334}</span>
</p>

<p>
He did not sleep that night, and the next morning
(Tuesday) he was very feverish, with a bright colour on
his usually white face.  I wanted to send the dogs from
the room, because I feared they would disturb him, but
he opened his eyes and said: "Not Grouse; let old Grouse
stay, I like him there."
</p>

<p>
His doctor said that for a day or two we could not
look for much improvement.  After his medicine that
afternoon he lay quietly with his eyes closed, just smiling
if I touched him.  The doctor came in again, but there
was no change, and he left promising to call early the next
morning.  During the evening my husband seemed to
doze, and, listening intently, I heard him mutter "the
Conservative Party."
</p>

<p>
Late in the evening he suddenly opened his eyes and
said: "Kiss me, sweet Wifie, and I will try to sleep a
little."  I lay down by his side, and kissed the burning lips
he pressed to mine for the last time.  The fire of them,
fierce beyond any I had ever felt, even in his most loving
moods, startled me, and as I slipped my hand from under
his head he gave a little sigh and became unconscious.
The doctor came at once, but no remedies prevailed against
this sudden failure of the heart's action, and my husband
died without regaining consciousness, before his last kiss
was cold on my lips.
</p>

<p>
There is little more to add.  All that last night I sat
by my husband watching and listening for the look and
the word he would never give me again.  All that night
I whispered to him to speak to me, and I fancied that he
moved, and that the fools who said he was dead did not
really know.  He had never failed to answer my every
look and word before.  His face was so peaceful; so well,
all the tiredness had gone from it now.  I would not open
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P335"></a>335}</span>
the door because I feared to disturb him&mdash;he had always
liked us to be alone.  And the rain and the wind swept
about the house as though the whole world shared my
desolation.
</p>

<p>
He did not make any "dying speech," or refer in any
way at the last to his "Colleagues and the Irish people,"
as was at the time erroneously reported.  I was too broken
then and too indifferent to what any sensation-lovers put
about to contradict this story, but, as I am now giving to
the world the absolutely true account of the Parnell whom
I knew and loved, I am able to state that he was incapable
of an affectation so complete.  The last words Parnell
spoke were given to the wife who had never failed him, to
the love that was stronger than death&mdash;"Kiss me, sweet
Wifie, and I will try to sleep a little."

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
